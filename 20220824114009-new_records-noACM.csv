The National Institutes of General Medical Science sepsis research working group recommendations call for application of new research approaches in extant clinical data sets to improve efficiency of early trials of new sepsis therapies. Our objective is to apply machine learning approaches to derive computable 24-h sepsis phenotypes to facilitate personalized enrollment in early anti-inflammatory trials targeting these conditions.Methods: We applied consensus, k-means clustering analysis to our extant PHENOtyping sepsis-induced Multiple organ failure Study (PHENOMS) dataset of 404 children. 24-hour computable phenotypes are derived using 25 available bedside variables including C-reactive protein and ferritin.Results: Four computable phenotypes (PedSep-A, B, C, and D) are derived. Compared to all other phenotypes, PedSep-A patients (n = 135; 2% mortality) were younger and previously healthy, with the lowest C-reactive protein and ferritin levels, the highest lymphocyte and platelet counts, highest heart rate, and lowest creatinine (p < 0.05); PedSep-B patients (n = 102; 12% mortality) were most likely to be intubated and had the lowest Glasgow Coma Scale Score (p < 0.05); PedSep-C patients (n = 110; mortality 10%) had the highest temperature and Glasgow Coma Scale Score, least pulmonary failure, and lowest lymphocyte counts (p < 0.05); and PedSep-D patients (n = 56, 34% mortality) had the highest creatinine and number of organ failures, including renal, hepatic, and hematologic organ failure, with the lowest platelet counts (p < 0.05). PedSep-D had the highest likelihood of developing thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure (Adj OR 47.51 95% CI [18.83-136.83], p < 0.0001) and macrophage activation syndrome (Adj OR 38.63 95% CI [13.26-137.75], p < 0.0001).Conclusions: Four computable phenotypes are derived, with PedSep-D being optimal for enrollment in early personalized anti-inflammatory trials targeting thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure and macrophage activation syndrome in pediatric sepsis. A computer tool for identification of individual patient membership ( www.pedsepsis.pitt.edu ) is provided.

A pilot, prospective randomized single blinded study was conducted on 40 patients in the ENT Department, Kasr Al-Aini Hospital, Cairo University during the period from April to December 2003. Patients were randomized into two groups each consisting of 20 patients. The first group was treated by submucosal channeling of the palate, while the second group was treated by radiofrequency assisted uvulopalatoplasty (RAUP). Patients were followed for 4 months, filling a questionnaire in a standard visual analogue score pattern. Assessment was done prior to the surgery and was repeated 3, 10 days and 3 weeks postoperatively. Visual analogue scores were done for the following parameters: pain, speech deficits, dysphagia, and snoring (by the bed partner). Polysomnography was done pre to intervention and was repeated 4 months postoperatively.

All-night polysomnography and heart rate variability were recorded. Frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability was performed for the central five-minute sample of the longest uninterrupted interval of slow wave and rapid eye movement sleep, as well as for one-minute samples during apnea and during slow wave and rapid eye movement sleep after resumption of respiration., RESULTS: Compared to the placebo, sildenafil was associated with an increase in the normalized high-frequency (HF(nu)) components and a decrease in the low/high-frequency components of the heart rate variability ratio (LF/HF) in slow wave sleep (p<0.01 for both). Differences in heart rate variability parameters between one-minute post-apnea and apnea samples (Delta = difference between resumption of respiration and apnea) were assessed. A trend toward a decreasing magnitude of DeltaLF activity was observed during rapid eye movement sleep with sildenafil in comparison to placebo (p=0.046). Additionally, DeltaLF/HF in SWS and rapid eye movement sleep was correlated with mean desaturation (s(R =) -0.72 and -0.51, respectively, p= 0.01 for both), and DeltaHF(nu) in rapid eye movement sleep was correlated with mean desaturation (s(R=) 0.66, p= 0.02) and the desaturation index (s(R=) 0.58, p = 0.047)., CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in arousal response to apnea/hypopnea events along with the increase in HF(nu) components and decrease in LH/HF components of the heart rate variability ratio during slow wave sleep suggest that, in addition to worsening sleep apnea, sildenafil has potentially immediate cardiac effects in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea.",2010,2022-08-24T07:19:19Z,2022-08-24T07:19:19Z,2010-01-01,393,NA,4,65,NA,"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00773066,"*Autonomic Nervous System/de [Drug Effects]; *Heart Rate/de [Drug Effects]; *Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors/pd [Pharmacology]; *Piperazines/pd [Pharmacology]; *Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/pp [Physiopathology]; *Sulfones/pd [Pharmacology]; Adult; Body Mass Index; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors/ae [Adverse Effects]; Piperazines/ae [Adverse Effects]; Polysomnography; Purines/ae [Adverse Effects]; Purines/pd [Pharmacology]; Respiration; Sildenafil Citrate; Sleep, REM/de [Drug Effects]; Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; Sulfones/ae [Adverse Effects]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to identify variables predictive of weight loss success in obese patients with OSA undertaking an intensive weight loss programme. Methods: We analysed biological, psychological, and behavioural variables as potential predictors of weight loss in obese patients with OSA after a 2-month VLED followed by one of two 10-month weight loss maintenance diets. Actigraphy, in-lab polysomnography, urinary catecholamines, and various psychological and behavioural variables were measured at baseline, 2, and 12 months. Spearman’s correlations analysed baseline variables with 2-month weight loss, and 2-month variables with 2–12 month-weight change. Results: Forty-two patients completed the VLED and thirty-eight completed the maintenance diets. Actigraphy data revealed that late bedtime (rs = − 0.45, p = < 0.01) was correlated with 2-month weight loss. The change in the time that participants got out of bed (rise-time) from baseline to two months was also correlated with 2-month weight loss (rs = 0.36, p = 0.03). The Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite questionnaire (IWQOL) Public Distress domain (rs = − 0.54, p = < 0.01) and total (rs = − 0.38, p = 0.02) scores were correlated with weight loss maintenance from 2 to 12 months. Conclusions: Results from this small patient sample reveal correlations between actigraphy characteristics and weight loss in obese patients with OSA. We suggest the IWQOL may also be a useful clinical tool to identify OSA patients at risk of weight regain after initial weight loss.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicentre, controlled, prospective endpoint trial, 19 084 hypertensive patients (10 614 men/8470 women, 60.5â‰Â±â‰13.7â‰years of age) were assigned (1:1) to ingest the entire daily dose of â‰¥1 hypertension medications at bedtime (nâ‰=â‰9552) or all of them upon awakening (nâ‰=â‰9532). At inclusion and at every scheduled clinic visit (at least annually) throughout follow-up, ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring was performed for 48â‰h. During the 6.3-year median patient follow-up, 1752 participants experienced the primary CVD outcome (CVD death, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure, or stroke). Patients of the bedtime, compared with the upon-waking, treatment-time regimen showed significantly lower hazard ratio-adjusted for significant influential characteristics of age, sex, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, smoking, HDL cholesterol, asleep systolic blood pressure (BP) mean, sleep-time relative systolic BP decline, and previous CVD event-of the primary CVD outcome [0.55 (95% CI 0.50-0.61), Pâ‰<â‰0.001] and each of its single components (Pâ‰<â‰0.001 in all cases), i.e. CVD death [0.44 (0.34-0.56)], myocardial infarction [0.66 (0.52-0.84)], coronary revascularization [0.60 (0.47-0.75)], heart failure [0.58 (0.49-0.70)], and stroke [0.51 (0.41-0.63)]. CONCLUSION: Routine ingestion by hypertensive patients of â‰¥1 prescribed BP-lowering medications at bedtime, as opposed to upon waking, results in improved ABP control (significantly enhanced decrease in asleep BP and increased sleep-time relative BP decline, i.e. BP dipping) and, most importantly, markedly diminished occurrence of major CVD events.

Restriction of time in bed (TIB) is assumed to be the central mechanism through which SRT improves sleep consolidation and reduces insomnia symptoms. This hypothesis has never been directly tested. We designed a randomized, controlled, dismantling trial in order to isolate the role of TIB restriction in driving both clinical and polysomnographic sleep outcomes., METHODS: Participants aged 25-55 who met diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were block-randomized (1:1) to 4 weeks of SRT or time in bed regularization (TBR), a treatment that involves the prescription of a regular but not reduced TIB. The primary outcome was assessed with the insomnia severity index (ISI) at baseline, 4-, and 12-weeks post-randomization. Secondary outcomes included sleep continuity (assessed via polysomnography, actigraphy, and diary) and quality of life. We performed intention-to-treat analyses using linear mixed models., RESULTS: Fifty-six participants (39 females, mean age = 40.78 ± 9.08) were assigned to SRT (n = 27) or TBR (n = 29). Daily monitoring of sleep via diaries and actigraphy confirmed large group differences in TIB (d range = 1.63-1.98). At 4-weeks post-randomization, the adjusted mean difference for the ISI was -4.49 (d = -1.40) and -4.35 at 12 weeks (d = -1.36), indicating that the SRT group reported reduced insomnia severity relative to TBR.

DESIGN: Double-blinded, counterbalanced, randomized, cross-over study. METHODS: Sleep was assessed using wrist activity monitors and sleep diaries in 15 elite male Australian Football League players on two training and nontraining days following evening consumption of an isocaloric whey protein supplement or placebo in preseason. A 5-day preintervention period was implemented to determine habitual dietary intake and baseline sleep measures. These habitual data were used to inform the daily dietary intake and timing of ingestion of the evening whey protein supplement or placebo on the intervention days. The whey protein supplement or placebo was consumed 3 hr prior to habitual bedtime. RESULTS: Separate one-way repeated-measures analyses of covariance revealed no differences between the whey protein supplement and the placebo on sleep duration, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, or wake after sleep onset on either training or nontraining days. CONCLUSIONS: Evening whey protein supplementation, rich in tryptophan, does not improve acute sleep duration or quality in elite male Australian Football League players. However, elite athletes may be able to ingest a high protein/energy intake close to bedtime without impairing sleep, which is important for athlete recovery. Future research should investigate the effect of evening protein intake, high in tryptophan, on sleep duration and quality, including sleep staging during periods of restricted sleep and in poor-sleeping athletes.",2022,2022-08-24T07:19:19Z,2022-08-24T07:19:19Z,2022-01-01,82,NA,2,32,NA,International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-02359021,Actigraphy; Athletes; Australia; Cross-Over Studies; Football; Humans; Male; Sleep; Tryptophan; Whey Proteins,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Its short half-life and immediate-release formulation require patients to awaken 2.5–4 h after their bedtime dose to take a second dose. A novel extended-release, once-nightly sodium oxybate formulation (ON-SXB; FT218) is under US Food and Drug Administration review for the treatment of adults with narcolepsy. Objective: A phase III trial of ON-SXB in individuals with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) or 2 (NT2) [the REST-ON trial; NCT02720744] has been conducted and the primary results reported elsewhere. Secondary objectives from REST-ON were to assess the efficacy of ON-SXB on disrupted nighttime sleep; the results of this analysis are reported here. Methods: In the double-blind, phase III REST-ON trial, patients aged ≥ 16 years were randomly assigned 1:1 to ON-SXB (1 week, 4.5 g; 2 weeks, 6 g; 5 weeks, 7.5 g; 5 weeks, 9 g) or placebo. Secondary endpoints included polysomnographic measures of sleep stage shifts and nocturnal arousals and patient-reported assessments of sleep quality and refreshing nature of sleep at 6, 7.5, and 9 g; post hoc analyses included changes in time spent in each sleep stage, delta power, and assessments in stimulant-use subgroups for prespecified endpoints. Results: In total, 190 participants (n = 97, ON-SXB; n = 93, placebo) were included in the efficacy analyses. All three ON-SXB doses demonstrated a clinically meaningful, statistically significant decrease vs placebo in the number of transitions to wake/N1 from N1, N2, and rapid eye movement (REM) stages (all doses p < 0.001) and the number of nocturnal arousals (p < 0.05 ON-SXB 6 g; p < 0.001 7.5 and 9 g). Sleep quality and refreshing nature of sleep were significantly improved with all three ON-SXB doses vs placebo (p < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed a significant reduction in time spent in N1 (p < 0.05 ON-SXB 6 g; p < 0.001 7.5 and 9 g) and REM (all p < 0.001) and increased time spent in N3 with ON-SXB vs placebo (all p < 0.001), with a significant increase in delta power (p < 0.01 ON-SXB 6 g; p < 0.05 7.5 g; p < 0.001 9 g) and increased REM latency (ON-SXB 7.5 g vs placebo; p < 0.05). Significant improvements in disrupted nighttime sleep were observed regardless of concomitant stimulant use. Conclusions: The clinically beneficial, single nighttime dose of ON-SXB significantly improved disrupted nighttime sleep in patients with narcolepsy.

METHODS: In a randomized crossover design, 17 high-performance junior tennis players completed the baseline, control, and intervention (INT) conditions across 3 separate weeks. The baseline consisted of unassisted, habitual sleep during a regular training week, and the control was unassisted sleep during a tournament week. The players attended a sleep education workshop and completed a nightly sleep hygiene protocol during a tournament week for the INT. Analysis was performed on the weekly means and on the night prior to the first match of the tournament (T-1). RESULTS: Significant differences were observed for increased time in bed, total sleep time, and an earlier bedtime (P < .05) across the INT week. These parameters also significantly improved on T-1 of the INT. A moderate effect size (P > .05, d > 1.00) was evident for decreased worry on T-1 of the INT. Small effect sizes were also evident for improved mood, cognitive anxiety, and sleep rating across the INT week. The match performance outcomes remained unchanged (P > .05).

To estimate reliability, paired assessments (four/patient) measured correlation between assessments of the same type (e.g., MAAS-MAAS). Generalized estimating equations, which accounted for the four repeated measures in each patient, supported MAAS validity by finding a linear trend between MAAS and the visual analog scale (p < .001), blood pressure (p < .001), heart rate (p < .001), and agitation-related sequelae (p < .001) end points. The MAAS (kappa = 0.83 [95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94]) was found to be more reliable than subjective assessment using the visual analog scale (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.32 [95% confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.55])., CONCLUSIONS: The MAAS is a valid and reliable sedation scale for use with mechanically ventilated patients in the SICU. Further studies are warranted regarding the effect of MAAS implementation in our SICU on patient outcomes, such as quality of sedation and length of mechanical ventilation, as well as the use of the MAAS in other patient populations (e.g., medical).",1999,2022-08-24T07:19:20Z,2022-08-24T07:19:20Z,1999-01-01,1271,NA,7,27,NA,Critical care medicine,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00166393,"*Drug Monitoring/mt [Methods]; *Hypnotics and Sedatives/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Psychometrics/mt [Methods]; *Psychomotor Agitation/di [Diagnosis]; *Respiration, Artificial/nu [Nursing]; Adult; Female; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Care; Psychomotor Agitation/pc [Prevention & Control]; Reproducibility of Results",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This condition causes recurrent insomnia and daytime sleepiness when the rhythms drift out of phase with the normal 24-hour cycle. We investigated whether a daily dose of melatonin could entrain their circadian rhythms to a normal 24-hour cycle., METHODS: We performed a crossover study involving seven totally blind subjects who had free-running circadian rhythms. The subjects were given 10 mg of melatonin or placebo daily, one hour before their preferred bedtime, for three to nine weeks. They were then given the other treatment. The timing of the production of endogenous melatonin was measured as a marker of the circadian time (phase), and sleep was monitored by polysomnography., RESULTS: At base line, the subjects had free-running circadian rhythms with distinct and predictable cycles averaging 24.5 hours (range, 24.2 to 24.9). These rhythms were unaffected by the administration of placebo. In six of the seven subjects the rhythm was entrained to a 24.0-hour cycle during melatonin treatment (P<0.001). After entrainment, the subjects spent less time awake after the initial onset of sleep (P=0.05) and the efficiency of sleep was higher (P=0.06). Three subjects subsequently participated in a trial in which a 10-mg dose of melatonin was given daily until entrainment was achieved. The dose was then reduced to 0.5 mg per day over a period of three months; the entrainment persisted, even at the lowest dose., CONCLUSIONS: Administration of melatonin can entrain circadian rhythms in most blind people who have free-running rhythms.",2000,2022-08-24T07:19:20Z,2022-08-24T07:19:20Z,2000-01-01,1070,NA,15,343,NA,New England journal of medicine,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00299745,*Blindness/pp [Physiopathology]; *Circadian Rhythm/de [Drug Effects]; *Dyssomnias/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Melatonin/pd [Pharmacology]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; Adult; Blindness/co [Complications]; Cross-Over Studies; Dyssomnias/et [Etiology]; Female; Humans; Male; Melatonin/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Melatonin/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Middle Aged; Polysomnography; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/dt [Drug Therapy]; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/et [Etiology],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Outpatient treatment lasted 6 weeks, with follow-up conducted at 6 months., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Objective (polysomnography) and subjective (sleep log) measures of total sleep time, middle and terminal wake time after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency; questionnaire measures of global insomnia symptoms, sleep-related self-efficacy, and mood., RESULTS: Cognitive behavioral therapy produced larger improvements across the majority of outcome measures than did RT or placebo treatment. For example, sleep logs showed that CBT-treated patients achieved an average 54% reduction in their WASO whereas RT-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively, achieved only 16% and 12% reductions in this measure. Recipients of CBT also showed a greater normalization of sleep and subjective symptoms than did the other groups with an average sleep time of more than 6 hours, middle WASO of 26.6 minutes, and sleep efficiency of 85.1%.

In recent years, specialized beds that provide automated turning have been introduced. These beds have been reported to improve lung function, reduce hospital-acquired pneumonia, and facilitate secretion removal. This trial was designed to measure the physiological effects of routine turning and respiratory therapy in comparison with continuous lateral rotation (CLR)., METHODS: The study was a prospective, quasi-experimental, random assignment, trial with patients serving as their own controls. Paralyzed, sedated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome were eligible for study. Patients were randomized to receive four turning and secretion management regimens in random sequence for 6 h each over a period of 24 h: (1) routine turning every 2 h from the left to right lateral position; (2) routine turning every 2 h from the left to right lateral position including a 15-min period of manual percussion and postural drainage (P&PD); (3) CLR with a specialized bed that turned patients from left to right lateral position, pausing at each position for 2 min; and (4) CLR with a specialized bed that turned patients from left to right lateral position pausing at each position for 2 min, and a 15-min period of percussion provided by the pneumatic cushions of the bed every 2 h., RESULTS: Nineteen patients were entered into the study. There were no statistically significant differences in the measured cardiorespiratory variables. There was a tendency for the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen concentration (PaO2/FIO2) to increase (174 +/- 31 versus 188 +/- 36; P = 0.068) and for the ratio of deadspace to tidal volume (Vd/Vt) to decrease (0.62 +/- 0.18 versus 0.59 +/- 0.18; P = 0.19) during periods of CLR, but these differences did not achieve statistical significance. There were statistically significant increases in sputum volume during the periods of CLR. The addition of P&PD did not increase sputum volume for the group as a whole. However, in the four patients producing more than 40 ml of sputum per day, P&PD increased sputum volume significantly.

We aimed to investigate these claims by comparing emerging adults' sleep outcomes associated with smartphone use before bed with iPhone's Night Shift enabled to two comparison conditions (iPhone use with no Night Shift, no iPhone use). DESIGN: Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions specifying iPhone use during the hour preceding bedtime for seven consecutive nights: iPhone use with Night Shift enabled; iPhone use with Night Shift disabled; and no phone use. SETTING: Participants were recruited from a western undergraduate university. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 167 emerging adults (ages 18-24; 71.3% female) with iPhones participated in the study. MEASUREMENTS: Sleep outcomes (sleep latency, duration, efficiency and wake after sleep onset) were tracked using wrist-worn accelerometers. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in sleep outcomes across the three experimental groups. Post-hoc exploratory stratified analyses revealed a significant main effect of phone condition on sleep efficiency (P = .014) and WASO (P = .013) for participants averaging more than 6.8 hours of sleep per night, with the no phone condition demonstrating the best sleep outcomes.

The benefit could only partly be attributed to the modest mean reduction of office blood pressure (OBP) during the study period (3/2 mm Hg). However, because according to the HOPE protocol ramipril was given once daily at bedtime and blood pressure was measured during the day, the 24-hour reduction of blood pressure may be underestimated based on OBP. Thirty-eight patients with peripheral arterial disease enrolled in the HOPE study underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measurement before randomization and after 1 year. OBP was measured in the sitting position immediately before fitting the ABP measuring equipment to the patients. Ramipril did not significantly reduce OBP (8/2 mm Hg, P=NS) or day ABP (6/2 mm Hg, P=NS) after 1 year. Twenty-four-hour ABP was significantly reduced (10/4 mm Hg, P=0.03), mainly because of a more pronounced blood pressure lowering effect during nighttime (17/8 mm Hg, P<0.001). The night/day ratio was also significantly lowered in the ramipril group. ABP shows greater falls, especially at night, than OBP during treatment with ramipril given once daily at bedtime. Although, OBP is the correct comparator when comparing with previous large intervention trials and epidemiological studies, the effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality seen with ramipril in the HOPE study may, to a larger extent than previously ascribed, relate to effects on blood pressure patterns over the 24-hour period.",2001,2022-08-24T07:19:20Z,2022-08-24T07:19:20Z,2001-01-01,E28,NA,6,38,NA,"Hypertension (dallas, tex. :",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00376488,"*Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Hypertension/pp [Physiopathology]; *Peripheral Vascular Diseases/co [Complications]; *Ramipril/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Aged; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Cardiovascular Diseases/et [Etiology]; Cardiovascular Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control]; Circadian Rhythm; Female; Humans; Hypertension/di [Diagnosis]; Hypertension/et [Etiology]; Male",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Zeitgeber influence of light on the timing of sleep is assumed to be mediated by melatonin, a hormone of the pineal gland, whose secretion is inhibited by light and enhanced during darkness. Here, we investigated whether a single administration of melatonin improves sleep and associated neuroendocrine patterns in blind individuals. In a double-blind crossover study, 12 totally blind subjects received 5 mg melatonin and placebo orally 1 h before bedtime starting at 2300 h. The dose used enhanced blood melatonin concentrations to clearly supraphysiological levels. Melatonin increased total sleep time and sleep efficiency (P < 0.05, respectively) and reduced time awake (P < 0.05). The increment in total sleep time was primarily due to an increase in stage 2 sleep (P < 0.01) and a slight increase in rapid eye movement sleep (P < 0.06). Most important, melatonin normalized in parallel the temporal pattern of ACTH and cortisol plasma concentration. While after placebo, ACTH and cortisol levels did not differ between early and late sleep, melatonin induced the typical suppression of pituitary-adrenal activity during early sleep and a distinct rise during late sleep (P < 0.01, respectively). Cortisol nadir values were also decreased after melatonin (P < 0.05). We conclude from these data that in totally blind individuals the single administration of a clearly pharmacological dose of melatonin can improve sleep function by synchronizing in time the inhibition of pituitary-adrenal activity with central nervous sleep processes.",2003,2022-08-24T07:19:20Z,2022-08-24T07:19:20Z,2003-01-01,5315,NA,11,88,NA,Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00458703,"*Adjuvants, Immunologic/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Blindness/co [Complications]; *Melatonin/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic/dt [Drug Therapy]; Adolescent; Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/bl [Blood]; Adult; Blindness/pp [Physiopathology]; Cross-Over Studies; Humans; Hydrocortisone/bl [Blood]; Male; Neurosecretory Systems/ph [Physiology]; Polysomnography; Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic/et [Etiology]; Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic/pp [Physiopathology]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Each subject underwent a laboratory-adaptation session before entering the sleep-deprivation phase of the study., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 21 healthy adults (aged 21-38 years) completed the experiment., INTERVENTIONS: Subjects came to the laboratory 3 times at intervals of at least 2 weeks. During each laboratory session, they underwent neurobehavioral testing every 2 hours during 36 hours of total sleep deprivation, which was preceded by baseline sleep and followed by recovery sleep. In the week prior to each sleep-deprivation session and on the baseline night in the laboratory, subjects were required to either restrict their sleep to 6 hours per day (prior sleep restriction condition) or to extend their time in bed to 12 hours per day (prior sleep extension condition), so as to experimentally manipulate sleep history (in randomized counterbalanced order)., RESULTS: There was strong evidence that interindividual differences in neurobehavioral deficits during sleep deprivation were systematic and trait-like. The magnitude of interindividual variability was substantial relative to the magnitude of the effect of prior sleep restriction (which on average involved a reduction of 4.1 hours sleep per day, compared to prior sleep extension, for 7 days). Overall, interindividual differences were not explained by subjects' baseline functioning or a variety of other potential predictors. Interindividual variability clustered on 3 distinct neurobehavioral dimensions: self-evaluation of sleepiness, fatigue, and mood; cognitive processing capability; and behavioral alertness as measured by sustained attention performance., CONCLUSIONS: Neurobehavioral deficits from sleep loss varied significantly among individuals and were stable within individuals.

In the 7- and 5-h groups speed initially declined, then appeared to stabilize at a reduced level; lapses were increased only in the 5-h group. In the 9-h group, speed and lapses remained at baseline levels.

The total sleep deprivation experiment involved 3 nights without sleep (0 h time in bed). Each study also involved 3 baseline (pre-deprivation) days and 3 recovery days., SETTING: Both experiments were conducted under standardized laboratory conditions with continuous behavioral, physiological and medical monitoring., PARTICIPANTS: A total of n = 48 healthy adults (ages 21-38) participated in the experiments., INTERVENTIONS: Noctumal sleep periods were restricted to 8 h, 6 h or 4 h per day for 14 days, or to 0 h for 3 days. All other sleep was prohibited., RESULTS: Chronic restriction of sleep periods to 4 h or 6 h per night over 14 consecutive days resulted in significant cumulative, dose-dependent deficits in cognitive performance on all tasks. Subjective sleepiness ratings showed an acute response to sleep restriction but only small further increases on subsequent days, and did not significantly differentiate the 6 h and 4 h conditions. Polysomnographic variables and delta power in the non-REM sleep EEG-a putative marker of sleep homeostasis--displayed an acute response to sleep restriction with negligible further changes across the 14 restricted nights. Comparison of chronic sleep restriction to total sleep deprivation showed that the latter resulted in disproportionately large waking neurobehavioral and sleep delta power responses relative to how much sleep was lost. A statistical model revealed that, regardless of the mode of sleep deprivation, lapses in behavioral alertness were near-linearly related to the cumulative duration of wakefulness in excess of 15.84 h (s.e. 0.73 h)., CONCLUSIONS: Since chronic restriction of sleep to 6 h or less per night produced cognitive performance deficits equivalent to up to 2 nights of total sleep deprivation, it appears that even relatively moderate sleep restriction can seriously impair waking neurobehavioral functions in healthy adults. Sleepiness ratings suggest that subjects were largely unaware of these increasing cognitive deficits, which may explain why the impact of chronic sleep restriction on waking cognitive functions is often assumed to be benign. Physiological sleep responses to chronic restriction did not mirror waking neurobehavioral responses, but cumulative wakefulness in excess of a 15.84 h predicted performance lapses across all four experimental conditions.

We compared two such robots, EndoAssist and AESOP, by evaluating timed setup and surgical performance during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP)., METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 20 patients undergoing LRP using either the EndoAssist or AESOP. AESOP was mounted to the surgical bed and controlled by an experienced assistant using a hand-held remote control. The EndoAssist device was placed over the patient's right shoulder. Its movements were executed by the surgeon using a head-mounted optical emitter with brief head movements detected by a sensor mounted atop the surgeon's video monitor. The robot setup time and LRP operative steps were timed and compared between the two cohorts., RESULTS: The time for robot setup favored AESOP over the EndoAssist (2.0 minutes versus 5.3 minutes, P = 0.001). The time for accomplishing vas deferens and seminal vesicle dissection favored the EndoAssist (23 minutes versus 33 minutes, P = 0.04). However, no statistically significant difference was found in the efficiency of task performance between the two robots in any of the other 11 steps measured., CONCLUSIONS: The EndoAssist appears to be equally efficient to the assistant-controlled AESOP robot with respect to surgical performance during LRP. The advantages of the EndoAssist include its accurate response and ability to provide the surgeon with complete control of the desired operative view without relying on an assistant. Its disadvantages include its large profile, lack of a table-mounted design, and the need for pedal activation. Additional modifications are needed to improve the efficiency and design of this novel robotic device further.",2006,2022-08-24T07:19:21Z,2022-08-24T07:19:21Z,2006-01-01,70,NA,1,68,NA,Urology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00566552,*Robotics/is [Instrumentation]; *Video-Assisted Surgery/is [Instrumentation]; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Pilot Projects; Prostatectomy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been shown to produce modest reductions in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, they have not been proven to be generally effective as treatments for OSA. Conversely, antagonists of type 3 (5-HT3) serotonin receptors effectively have been shown to reduce the frequency of central apneas during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in a rodent model of sleep-related breathing disorder. We sought to determine whether mirtazapine, a mixed 5-HT2/5-HT3 antagonist that also promotes serotonin release in the brain would effectively reduce AHI during both NREM and REM sleep in patients with OSA., DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-way crossover study of mirtazapine in patients with OSA., SETTING: Laboratory studies were conducted in the Center for Sleep and Ventilatory Disorders at the University of Illinois Medical Center., PATIENTS: Seven adult men and 5 adult women with newly diagnosed (treatment-naïve) and medically uncomplicated OSA were randomized into the study., INTERVENTIONS: Each subject self-administered oral medications 30 minutes before bedtime each night for 3 consecutive 7-day treatment periods. These treatments comprised (1) placebo, (2) 4.5 mg per day of mirtazapine, and (3) 15 mg per day of mirtazapine. The order of treatments was randomized for each subject, and orders were counterbalanced for the overall study., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Each subject charted his or her sleep-wake schedule throughout the study and completed the Stanford Sleepiness Scale every 2 hours during the seventh day of each treatment period. Subjects were studied by laboratory polysomnography on the seventh night of each treatment period. With respect to placebo treatment, 4.5 mg of mirtazapine significantly reduced the AHI in all sleep stages to 52%, with 11 of 12 subjects showing improvement over placebo; 15 mg of mirtazapine reduced the AHI to 46%, with 12 of 12 subjects showing improvement over placebo. Sleep fragmentation was reduced only by the higher dose of mirtazapine. Gross changes in sleep architecture were unremarkable., CONCLUSIONS: Daily administration of 4.5 to 15 mg of mirtazapine for 1 week reduces AHI by half in adult patients with OSA. This represents the largest and most consistent drug-treatment effect demonstrated to date in a controlled trial. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of mixed-profile serotonergic drugs in OSA and provide support for future studies with related formulations. Mirtazapine also is associated with sedation and weight gain-2 negative side effects in patients with OSA. In view of the above, we do not recommend use of mirtazapine as a treatment for OSA.",2007,2022-08-24T07:19:21Z,2022-08-24T07:19:21Z,2007-01-01,35,NA,1,30,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00578597,"*Mianserin/aa [Analogs & Derivatives]; *Serotonin Antagonists/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/dt [Drug Therapy]; Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cross-Over Studies; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Mianserin/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Middle Aged; Mirtazapine; Polysomnography/de [Drug Effects]; Serotonin 5-HT2 Receptor Antagonists; Serotonin 5-HT3 Receptor Antagonists",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, it remained unclear whether this effect was restricted to good memory performers and whether a general association of sleep spindles and a ""sleep-related learning trait"" may not account for this effect. Here we now present a secondary and more detailed analysis of our randomized multicenter study. Subjects were studied over a 4-week study period (including actigraphy and daily sleep diaries), including three overnight stays in the sleep laboratory. In the course of the study, subjects completed test-batteries of memory (Wechsler-Memory-Scale-revised; WMS) and other cognitive abilities (Raven's Advanced-Progressive-Matrices; APM) and were asked to study 160 word pairs in the evening before being tested by cued-recall. Afterwards, subjects went to bed in the laboratory with full polysomnographic montages. Additionally, subjects participated on another occasion in a non-learning control (perceptual priming) task that was counterbalanced either before or after the learning condition. Slow as well as fast spindle activities were analyzed at frontopolar and central topographies. Although it was found that spindle activity is generally (in learning as well as control nights) elevated in highly gifted subjects, spindle analyses revealed that spindle increase (control to learning night) is specifically related to explicit memory improvement overnight, independent of individual learning traits. Together these findings suggest that the spindle increase after learning is related to elaborate encoding before sleep, whereas an individual's general learning ability is well reflected in interindividual (and trait-like) differences of absolute sleep spindle activity.",2008,2022-08-24T07:19:21Z,2022-08-24T07:19:21Z,2008-01-01,127,NA,NA,1191,NA,Brain research,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00629080,*Association Learning/ph [Physiology]; *Cognition/ph [Physiology]; *Mental Recall/ph [Physiology]; *Sleep/ph [Physiology]; *Verbal Learning/ph [Physiology]; Adult; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials/ph [Physiology]; Female; Humans; Individuality; Male; Polysomnography; Reference Values,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A small, randomized, controlled trial has previously found an approximate halving in the severity of OSA with daily doses of 4.5 and 15 mg. We aimed to confirm and extend these findings in 2 randomized placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trials., METHODS: Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of mirtazapine for OSA (apnea-hypopnea index 10-40/h). Study 1: 3-way crossover, dose-finding study testing the self-administration of mirtazapine (7.5, 15, 30, and/or 45 mg) or placebo 30 minutes prior to bedtime for 2 weeks at each dose. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 different dose-sequence groups, with each patient exposed to a maximum of 3 doses. Study 2: 3-arm, randomized, parallel-group trial of mirtazapine at 15 mg or mirtazapine 15 mg + Compound CD0012 or placebo for 4 weeks in 65 patients with OSA., RESULTS: Two patients withdrew from Study 1 after complaints of unacceptable lethargy. Fifteen patients were withdrawn from study 2, 7 after complaints of unacceptable lethargy or other side-effects. No measurement of sleep apnea improved due to mirtazapine in either study. Weight gain was significantly greater on mirtazapine than on placebo in both trials., CONCLUSIONS: Mirtazapine did not improve sleep apnea in either trial.

It remains unclear which outcome measures best identify real CPAP effects and carry independent information., METHODS: One hundred-two men with moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnea were randomized to either ""real"" or ""sham"" CPAP for one month. Outcome measures were subjective sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]) and QOL measures includiig SF-36/SF-12 and Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI). The bed partner's QOL and rating of patient's response to CPAP were assessed with the Dublin questionnaire. All data were standardized using effect sizes and expressed as real minus sham to remove the nonspecific effects of placebo., RESULTS: Real CPAP was superior to sham CPAP in almost all outcome measures. ESS, patient's component from Dublin, and social interactions from SAQLI showed the largest differences in effect sizes between real and sham (1.33, 0.98, and 0.92 respectively). ESS carried the highest predictive power of real CPAP response (P < 0.0001, r2 = 0.21).

The best long-term outcome was obtained with patients treated with combined therapy initially, followed by CBT alone, as evidenced by higher remission rates at the 6-month follow-up compared with patients who continued to take zolpidem during extended therapy (68% [20/30] vs 42% [12/29]; P = .04)., CONCLUSION: In patients with persistent insomnia, the addition of medication to CBT produced added benefits during acute therapy, but long-term outcome was optimized when medication is discontinued during maintenance CBT., TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00042146.",2009,2022-08-24T07:19:21Z,2022-08-24T07:19:21Z,2009-01-01,2005,NA,19,301,NA,JAMA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00681902,*Hypnotics and Sedatives/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Pyridines/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/th [Therapy]; Aged; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Hypnotics and Sedatives/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Male; Middle Aged; Polysomnography; Pyridines/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Sleep; Zolpidem,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Outpatient treatment included 4 biweekly sessions with a posttreatment assessment and a follow-up conducted at 6 months., MEASURES AND RESULTS: Participants completed actigraphy and sleep diaries for 2 weeks prior to therapy, during a 2-week posttreatment assessment, and during 2 weeks at follow-up. They also completed questionnaires measuring global insomnia symptoms, general sleep quality, and sleep-disruptive beliefs before treatment, immediately following treatment, and at the follow-up time point. Consistent with previous studies, CBT outperformed sleep hygiene across several study outcome measures for the sample as a whole. Statistical analyses showed no significant 3-way interaction of treatment group, time, and insomnia type for any of the sleep or questionnaire measures, suggesting the benefits of CBT over sleep hygiene were comparable for patients with primary insomnia and comorbid insomnia. Moreover, only 1 of several indexes of clinically notable improvement suggested a significantly better response to CBT by patients with primary insomnia, as compared with those with comorbid insomnia., CONCLUSIONS: A fixed 4-session ""dose"" of CBT produced similar benefits for patients with primary and those with comorbid insomnia across most measures examined.

In spite of these published findings, most hypertensive subjects, including those under combination therapy, are instructed by their physicians and pharmacists to ingest all of their BP-lowering medications in the morning. The potential differential reduction of cardiovascular (CVD) morbidity and mortality risk by a bedtime versus upon-awakening treatment schedule has never been evaluated prospectively. The prospective MAPEC study was specifically designed to test the hypothesis that bedtime chronotherapy with ≥1 hypertension medications exerts better BP control and CVD risk reduction than conventional therapy, i.e., all medications ingested in the morning. A total of 2156 hypertensive subjects, 1044 men/1112 women, 55.6 ± 13.6 (mean ± SD) yrs of age, were randomized to ingest all their prescribed hypertension medications upon awakening or ≥1 of them at bedtime. At baseline, BP was measured at 20-min intervals from 07:00 to 23:00 h and at 30-min intervals at night for 48 h. Physical activity was simultaneously monitored every min by wrist actigraphy to accurately determine the beginning and end of daytime activity and nocturnal sleep. Identical assessment was scheduled annually and more frequently (quarterly) if treatment adjustment was required. Despite lack of differences in ambulatory BP between groups at baseline, subjects ingesting medication at bedtime showed at their last available evaluation significantly lower mean sleep-time BP, higher sleep-time relative BP decline, reduced prevalence of non-dipping (34% versus 62%; p < .001), and higher prevalence of controlled ambulatory BP (62% versus 53%; p < .001). After a median follow-up of 5.6 yrs, subjects ingesting ≥1 BP-lowering medications at bedtime exhibited a significantly lower relative risk of total CVD events than those ingesting all medications upon awakening (0.39 [0.29-0.51]; number of events 187 versus 68; p < .001). The difference between the treatment-time groups in the relative risk of major events (including CVD death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke) was also highly statistically significant (0.33 [0.19-0.55]; number of events: 55 versus 18; p < .001). The progressive decrease in asleep BP and increase in sleep-time relative BP decline towards a more normal dipping pattern, two novel therapeutic targets requiring proper patient evaluation by ambulatory BP, were best achieved with bedtime therapy, and they were the most significant predictors of event-free survival. Bedtime chronotherapy with ≥1 BP-lowering medications, compared to conventional upon-waking treatment with all medications, more effectively improved BP control, better decreased the prevalence of non-dipping, and, most importantly, significantly reduced CVD morbidity and mortality.",2010,2022-08-24T07:19:22Z,2022-08-24T07:19:22Z,2010-01-01,1629,NA,8,27,NA,Chronobiology international,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00768856,"*Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]; *Circadian Rhythm/ph [Physiology]; Actigraphy; Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Antihypertensive Agents/pd [Pharmacology]; Antihypertensive Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Biological Clocks/ph [Physiology]; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Cardiovascular Diseases/dt [Drug Therapy]; Cardiovascular Diseases/mo [Mortality]; Female; Humans; Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; Hypertension/pp [Physiopathology]; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived, anti-inflammatory hormone that is related to cardiovascular disease risk. We hypothesized that sleep restriction would reduce adiponectin levels in healthy young adults., METHODS: 74 healthy adults (57% men, 63% African American, mean age 29.9years) completed 2 nights of baseline sleep at 10h time in bed (TIB) per night followed by 5 nights of sleep restricted to 4h TIB per night. An additional 8 participants were randomized to a control group that received 10h TIB per night throughout the study.

Participants performed a test protocol of in-bed, transfer, and walking activities., RESULTS: The sensor system was highly accurate in classifying lying, sitting, and standing positions (100%) and in recognizing transitions from lying to sitting positions and from sitting to standing positions (100%). Placement of a sensor on the nonaffected leg resulted in less underestimation of step counts than placement on the affected leg. Still, the sensor system underestimated step counts during walking, especially at slow walking speeds (⩽0.47 m/s) (limits of agreement=-2.01 to 16.54, absolute percent error=40.31)., LIMITATIONS: The study was performed in a controlled setting and not during the natural performance of activities., CONCLUSIONS: The activPAL sensor system provides valid measures of postures and transitions in older people with impaired walking ability.

Both groups had to withhold their usual dopaminergic medication after noon. At bedtime, one group received 200 mg controlled-release (CR) levodopa/carbidopa, whilst the other group spent the night in the 'off'-state. Polysomnographic recordings were obtained in all patients and 16 age-matched, healthy controls., RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, patients with PD suffered from significantly decreased total sleep time, REM sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS), whilst the time spent awake was increased.

However, the impact on cardiovascular risk of changes in these ambulatory blood pressure characteristics has not been properly investigated., METHODS: We prospectively studied 3,344 subjects (1,718 men and 1,626 women), 52.6 ± 14.5 years of age, during a median follow-up of 5.6 years. Those with hypertension at baseline were randomized to ingest all their prescribed hypertension medications upon awakening or ≥1 of them at bedtime. Blood pressure was measured for 48 h at baseline and again annually or more frequently (quarterly) if treatment adjustment was required., RESULTS: With data collected at baseline, when asleep blood pressure was adjusted by awake mean, only the former was a significant predictor of outcome in a Cox proportional hazards model also adjusted for sex, age, and diabetes. Analyses of changes in ambulatory blood pressure during follow-up revealed a 17% reduction in cardiovascular risk for each 5-mm Hg decrease in asleep systolic blood pressure mean (p < 0.001), independently of changes in any other ambulatory blood pressure parameter., CONCLUSIONS: The sleep-time blood pressure mean is the most significant prognostic marker of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Most importantly, the progressive decrease in asleep blood pressure, a novel therapeutic target that requires proper patient evaluation by ambulatory monitoring, was the most significant predictor of event-free survival.

After screening PSG, participants consumed alcohol (sex/weight adjusted dosing) to intoxication [peak breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) of 0.11 ± 0.01 g% for men and women] or matching placebo between 20:30 and 22:00 hours. Sleep was monitored using PSG between 23:00 and 07:00 hours. Participants completed the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale at bedtime and on awakening and a validated post-sleep questionnaire., RESULTS: Following alcohol, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, nighttime awakenings, and wake after sleep onset were more disrupted in women than men, with no differences by family history status. Alcohol reduced sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, and rapid eye movement sleep while increasing wakefulness and slow wave sleep across the entire night compared with placebo. Alcohol also generally increased sleep consolidation in the first half of the night, but decreased it during the second half. Sleepiness ratings were higher following alcohol, particularly in women at bedtime.

Only the higher dose of THA significantly shortened REM latency.

The order of administration was reversed in half the patients. The efficacy of L-dopa was analyzed by using multilevel models. L-Dopa resulted in a significant decrease in the average number of bruxism episodes per hour of sleep, as well as in a significant reduction in the average value of the root-mean-square (RMS) electromyography (EMG) level per bruxism burst.

Most of these studies have been done in institutional settings and have used several hours of daily light exposure. Such a regimen in the home setting may be untenable, especially when the individual with the sleep disruption has memory impairment and is being cared for by a family member. As such, we examined the effectiveness of a ""user-friendly"" phototherapy protocol that would be readily usable in the home environment., METHODS: We exposed a group of 54 older caregiver/care recipient dyads, in which the care recipient had memory impairment, to two weeks of morning bright light phototherapy. Dyads were exposed to either bright white (∼4200 lux) or dim red (∼90 lux) light for 30 min every day, starting within 30 min of rising. All subjects also received sleep hygiene therapy. Objective (actigraphy) and subjective measures of sleep and mood were obtained at baseline and at the end of the two weeks of phototherapy., RESULTS: In care recipients, actigraphy- and log-determined time in bed and total sleep time declined in the active condition (p<0.05, ANOVA); there was no corresponding change in subjective insomnia symptoms (p's>0.37, ANOVA). The decrease in the time in bed was associated with an earlier out of bed time in the morning (p<0.001, Pearson correlation). The decrease in the total sleep time was associated with a decrease in sleep efficiency (p<0.001, Pearson correlation) and an increase in wake after sleep onset (p<0.001, Pearson correlation). In caregivers, there were no differential changes in actigraphic measures of sleep (p's>0.05, ANOVA). Actigraphy-measured wake after sleep onset and sleep efficiency did, however, improve in both conditions, as did sleepiness, insomnia symptoms, and depressive symptomatology (p's<0.05, ANOVA)., CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to this regimen of phototherapy diminished sleep in older individuals with memory impairments.

This study compares the effect of single component and multicomponent behavioral treatments for insomnia in older adults after intervention and at 3 months and 1 yr posttreatment., DESIGN: A randomized, controlled study., SETTING: Veterans Affairs medical center., PARTICIPANTS: 179 older adults (mean age, 68.9 yr ± 8.0; 115 women [64.2%]) with chronic primary insomnia., INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to 6 wk of stimulus control therapy (SCT), sleep restriction therapy (SRT), the 2 therapies combined into a multicomponent intervention (MCI), or a wait-list control group., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Primary outcomes were subjective (daily sleep diary) and objective (actigraphy) measures of sleep-onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), time in bed (TIB), and sleep efficiency (SE). Secondary outcomes were clinical measures including response and remission rates. There were no differences between the single and multicomponent interventions on primary sleep outcomes measured by diary and actigraphy. All treatments produced significant improvement in diary-reported sleep in comparison with the control group. Effect sizes for sleep diary outcomes were medium to large. Treatment gains were maintained at follow-up for diary and actigraph measured SOL, WASO, and SE. The MCI group had the largest proportion of treatment remitters., CONCLUSIONS: For older adults with chronic primary insomnia, the findings provide initial evidence that SCT, SRT, and MCI are equally efficacious and produce sustainable treatment gains on diary, actigraphy, and clinical outcomes. From a clinical perspective, MCI may be a preferred treatment due to its higher remission rate., CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: Behavioral Intervention for Insomnia in Older Adults. NCT01154023.

Some observational and physiological studies have shown that cold exposure increases BP, but evidence from a randomised controlled study assessing the effectiveness of intensive room heating for lowering BP was lacking., OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to determine whether intensive room heating in winter decreases ambulatory BP as compared with weak room heating resulting in a 10°C lower target room temperature when sufficient clothing and bedclothes are available., METHODS: We conducted a parallel group, assessor blinded, simple randomised controlled study with 1:1 allocation among 146 healthy participants in Japan from November 2009 to March 2010. Ambulatory BP was measured while the participants stayed in single experimental rooms from 21:00 to 8:00. During the session, participants could adjust the amount of clothing and bedclothes as required. Compared with the weak room heating group (mean temperature ± SD: 13.9 ± 3.3°C), systolic morning BP (mean BP 2 h after getting out of bed) of the intensive room heating group (24.2 ± 1.7°C) was significantly lower by 5.8 mm Hg (95% CI 2.4 to 9.3).

Drug was titrated based on nightmare response over 6 weeks to a possible maximum dose of 5 mg midmorning and 20 mg at bedtime for men and 2 mg midmorning and 10 mg at bedtime for women. Mean achieved bedtime doses were 15.6 mg of prazosin (SD=6.0) and 18.8 mg of placebo (SD=3.3) for men and 7.0 mg of prazosin (SD=3.5) and 10.0 mg of placebo (SD=0.0) for women. Mean achieved midmorning doses were 4.0 mg of prazosin (SD=1.4) and 4.8 mg of placebo (SD=0.8) for men and 1.7 mg of prazosin (SD=0.5) and 2.0 mg of placebo (SD=0.0) mg for women. Primary outcome measures were the nightmare item of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the change item of the Clinical Global Impressions Scale anchored to functioning. Secondary outcome measures were the 17-item CAPS, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Quality of Life Index.

Measures of sleep quality recorded by actigraphy and subjective sleep questionnaires were completed. Sequential urine samples over 48 h were collected and urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (major metabolite of melatonin) determined; cosinor analysis was used to determine melatonin circadian rhythm (mesor, acrophase and amplitude). In addition, total urinary melatonin content was determined over the sampled period. Trial differences were determined using a repeated measures ANOVA., RESULTS: Total melatonin content was significantly elevated (P < 0.05) in the cherry juice group, whilst no differences were shown between baseline and placebo trials. There were significant increases in time in bed, total sleep time and sleep efficiency total (P < 0.05) with cherry juice supplementation. Although there was no difference in timing of the melatonin circardian rhythm, there was a trend to a higher mesor and amplitude., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that consumption of a tart cherry juice concentrate provides an increase in exogenous melatonin that is beneficial in improving sleep duration and quality in healthy men and women and might be of benefit in managing disturbed sleep.",2012,2022-08-24T07:19:24Z,2022-08-24T07:19:24Z,2012-01-01,909,NA,8,51,NA,European journal of nutrition,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00882147,*Beverages/an [Analysis]; *Melatonin/aa [Analogs & Derivatives]; *Prunus/ch [Chemistry]; *Sleep Wake Disorders/th [Therapy]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; Actigraphy/mt [Methods]; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Over Studies; Dietary Supplements; Double-Blind Method; Female; Fruit/ch [Chemistry]; Humans; Male; Melatonin/ur [Urine]; Sleep Wake Disorders/pp [Physiopathology]; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, a direct link between sleep restriction and alterations in molecular metabolic pathways in any peripheral human tissue has not been shown., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether sleep restriction results in reduced insulin sensitivity in subcutaneous fat, a peripheral tissue that plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism and balance., DESIGN: Randomized, 2-period, 2-condition, crossover clinical study., SETTING: University of Chicago Clinical Resource Center., PARTICIPANTS: Seven healthy adults (1 woman, 6 men) with a mean age of 23.7 years (SD, 3.8) and mean body mass index of 22.8 kg/m(2) (SD, 1.6)., INTERVENTION: Four days of 4.5 hours in bed or 8.5 hours in bed under controlled conditions of caloric intake and physical activity., MEASUREMENTS: Adipocytes collected from subcutaneous fat biopsy samples after normal and restricted sleep conditions were exposed to incremental insulin concentrations. The ability of insulin to increase levels of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), a crucial step in the insulin-signaling pathway, was assessed. Total Akt (tAkt) served as a loading control. The insulin concentration for the half-maximal stimulation of the pAkt-tAkt ratio was used as a measure of cellular insulin sensitivity. Total body insulin sensitivity was assessed using a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test., RESULTS: The insulin concentration for the half-maximal pAkt-tAkt response was nearly 3-fold higher (mean, 0.71 nM [SD, 0.27] vs. 0.24 nM [SD, 0.24]; P = 0.01; mean difference, 0.47 nM [SD, 0.33]; P = 0.01), and the total area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the pAkt-tAkt response was 30% lower (P = 0.01) during sleep restriction than during normal sleep. A reduction in total body insulin sensitivity (P = 0.02) paralleled this impaired cellular insulin sensitivity., LIMITATION: This was a single-center study with a small sample size., CONCLUSION: Sleep restriction results in an insulin-resistant state in human adipocytes.

The most common treatment approaches for DSPD are based on the administration of bright light and/or exogenous melatonin with or without adjunct behavioural instructions. Much is generally known about the chronobiological effects of light and melatonin. However, placebo-controlled treatment studies for DSPD are scarce, in particular in adolescents and young adults, and no standardized guidelines exist regarding treatment. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the short- and long-term effects on sleep of a DSPD treatment protocol involving administration of timed bright light and melatonin alongside gradual advancement of rise time in adolescents and young adults with DSPD in a randomized controlled trial and an open label follow-up study. A total of 40 adolescents and young adults (age range 16-25 years) diagnosed with DSPD were recruited to participate in the study. The participants were randomized to receive treatment for two weeks in one of four treatment conditions: dim light and placebo capsules, bright light and placebo capsules, dim light and melatonin capsules or bright light and melatonin capsules. In a follow-up study, participants were re-randomized to either receive treatment with the combination of bright light and melatonin or no treatment in an open label trial for approximately three months. Light and capsules were administered alongside gradual advancement of rise times. The main end points were sleep as assessed by sleep diaries and actigraphy recordings and circadian phase as assessed by salivary dim light melatonin onset (DLMO). During the two-week intervention, the timing of sleep and DLMO was advanced in all treatment conditions as seen by about 1 h advance of bed time, 2 h advance of rise time and 2 h advance of DLMO in all four groups. Sleep duration was reduced with approximately 1 h. At three-month follow-up, only the treatment group had maintained an advanced sleep phase. Sleep duration had returned to baseline levels in both groups. In conclusion, gradual advancement of rise time produced a phase advance during the two-week intervention, irrespective of treatment condition. Termination of treatment caused relapse into delayed sleep times, whereas long-term treatment with bright light and melatonin (three months) allowed maintenance of the advanced sleep phase.",2014,2022-08-24T07:19:25Z,2022-08-24T07:19:25Z,2014-01-01,72,NA,1,31,NA,Chronobiology international,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01001748,*Melatonin/ch [Chemistry]; *Phototherapy/mt [Methods]; *Sleep Wake Disorders/th [Therapy]; Actigraphy; Adolescent; Adult; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Light; Male; Norway; Sleep Wake Disorders/dt [Drug Therapy]; Sleep/ph [Physiology]; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Given that adolescents often experience shortened sleep on school nights, we sought to better understand the effect of experimentally induced chronic sleep restriction on adolescents' mood and mood regulation., METHODS: Fifty healthy adolescents, ages 14-17, completed a 3-week sleep manipulation protocol involving a baseline week, followed by a sleep restriction (SR) condition (6.5 hr in bed per night for five nights) and healthy sleep duration (HS) condition (10 hr in bed per night for five nights). The study used a randomized, counterbalanced, crossover experimental design. Participants' sleep was monitored at home via self-report and actigraphy. At the end of each condition, participants and their parents completed questionnaires of mood and mood regulation. To assess for expectancy effects, we also analyzed parent and teen ratings of hyperactivity/impulsivity, which prior research suggests is not sensitive to SR in adolescents. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests compared questionnaire outcomes across the two conditions., RESULTS: Participants averaged 2.5 more hours of sleep per night during HS relative to SR. Compared with HS, adolescents rated themselves as significantly more tense/anxious, angry/hostile, confused, and fatigued, and as less vigorous (p = .001-.01) during SR. Parents and adolescents also reported greater oppositionality/irritability and poorer emotional regulation during SR compared with HS (p < .05). There were no cross-condition differences in depression or hyperactivity/impulsivity (p > .05)., CONCLUSIONS: Findings complement prior correlational study results to show that after only a few days of shortened sleep, at a level of severity that is experienced regularly by millions of adolescents on school nights, adolescents have worsened mood and decreased ability to regulate negative emotions.",2014,2022-08-24T07:19:25Z,2022-08-24T07:19:25Z,2014-01-01,180,NA,2,55,NA,"Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01013723,*Adolescent Behavior/ph [Physiology]; *Affect/ph [Physiology]; *Sleep Deprivation/co [Complications]; Actigraphy; Adolescent; Clinical Protocols; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Humans; Male,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Visual feedback of continuous interface pressure between the body and support surface could inform clinicians on repositioning strategies and play a key role in an overall strategy for the prevention and management of pressure ulcers., METHODS/DESIGN: A parallel two-group randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted to study the effect of continuous pressure imaging on reducing interface pressure and on the incidence of pressure ulcers in vulnerable hospital patients. A total of 678 eligible consenting inpatients at risk of pressure ulcer development in a tertiary acute care institution will be randomly allocated to either having the ForeSite PT™ system with the liquid-crystal display monitor turned on to provide visual feedback to the clinicians while also collecting continuous interface pressure data (intervention group) or to having the ForeSite PT™ system with monitor turned off (that is, not providing visual feedback) but still collecting continuous interface pressure data (control group), in a ratio of 1:1. Continuous interface pressure data will be collected in both groups for 3 days (72 h). Data collection will continue until discharge for a subset of approximately 60 patients. The primary outcome will be the differences in the two groups' interface pressure analysis. Interface pressure readings will be collected through hourly samplings of continuous interface pressure recordings. Secondary outcomes will be the differences between the two groups in pressure-related skin and soft tissue changes in areas at risk of pressure ulcer (obtained at baseline within 24 h of admission) and on the third day of the trial or at discharge and perceptions of the intervention by patients and clinicians (obtained on the third day or at discharge)., DISCUSSION: This will be the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of visual feedback with continuous interface pressure of vulnerable hospital patients across different care settings, and the association between interface pressure and development of pressure-related skin and soft tissue changes.

ANOVA was used to evaluate the interaction between sleep restriction and day for each pain-related variable., RESULTS: LEP-amplitude decreased after sleep restriction (interaction p=0.02) compared to subjects randomized to nine hours sleep. LEP-habituation was similar in both groups. Thenar cold pain threshold decreased after sleep restriction (interaction p=0.009). Supra-threshold heat pain rating increased temporarily 10s after stimulus onset after sleep restriction (interaction p=0.01), while it did not change after nine hours sleep., CONCLUSION: Sleep restriction reduced the CNS response to pain, while some of the subjective pain measures indicated hyperalgesia., SIGNIFICANCE: Since LEP-amplitude is known to reflect both CNS-pain-specific processing and cognitive attentive processing, our results suggest that hyperalgesia after sleep restriction might partly be caused by a reduction in cortical cognitive or perceptual mechanisms, rather than sensory amplification.",2015,2022-08-24T07:19:25Z,2022-08-24T07:19:25Z,2015-01-01,1979,NA,10,126,NA,Clinical neurophysiology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01111145,*Laser-Evoked Potentials/ph [Physiology]; *Pain Measurement/mt [Methods]; *Pain Threshold/ph [Physiology]; *Pain/pp [Physiopathology]; *Sleep Deprivation/pp [Physiopathology]; *Thermosensing/ph [Physiology]; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Pain/di [Diagnosis]; Polysomnography/mt [Methods]; Sleep Deprivation/di [Diagnosis]; Young Adult,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Sleep quality is influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, light, sound and smell. Here, we investigated whether differences in the interface pressure distribution on healthy individuals during sleep influenced sleep quality. We defined four types of pressure models by differences in the area distribution and the subjective feelings that occurred when participants slept on the mattresses. One type of model was showed ""over-concentrated"" distribution of pressure; one was displayed ""over-evenly"" distributed interface pressure while the other two models were displayed intermediate distribution of pressure. A polysomnography analysis demonstrated an increase in duration and proportion of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep stages 3 and 4, as well as decreased number of micro-arousals, in subjects sleeping on models with pressure intermediately distributed compared to models with over-concentrated or over-even distribution of pressure. Similarly, higher scores of self-reported sleep quality were obtained in subjects sleeping on the two models with intermediate pressure distribution. Thus, pressure distribution, at least to some degree, influences sleep quality and self-reported feelings of sleep-related events, though the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The regulation of pressure models imposed by external sleep environment may be a new direction for improving sleep quality.

Positioning of patients is an essential component of pressure ulcer prevention because it off-loads areas of high pressure. However, the effectiveness of such positioning is debatable. A continuous bedside pressure mapping (CBPM) device can provide real-time feedback of optimal body position though a pressure-sensing mat that displays pressure images at a patient's bedside, allowing off-loading of high-pressure areas and possibly preventing HAPU formation., METHODS: A prospective controlled study was designed to determine if CBPM would reduce the number of HAPUs in patients treated in our medical intensive care unit. In 2 months, 422 patients were enrolled and assigned to beds equipped with or without a CBPM device. Patients' skin was assessed daily and weekly to determine the presence and progress of HAPUs. All patients were turned every 2 hours. CBPM patients were repositioned to off-load high-pressure points during turning, according to a graphic display. The number of newly formed HAPUs was the primary outcome measured. A &khgr;(2) test was then used to compare the occurrence of HAPUs between groups., RESULTS: HAPUs developed in 2 of 213 patients in the CBPM group (0.9%; both stage II) compared with 10 of 209 in the control group (4.8%; all stage II; P = .02)., CONCLUSION: Significantly fewer HAPUs occurred in the CBPM group than the control group, indicating the effectiveness of real-time visual feedback in repositioning of patients to prevent the formation of new HAPUs.",2014,2022-08-24T07:19:26Z,2022-08-24T07:19:26Z,2014-01-01,127,NA,2,23,NA,American journal of critical care,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01118116,"*Patient Positioning/st [Standards]; *Pressure Ulcer/pc [Prevention & Control]; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Beds; Female; Humans; Intensive Care Units/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]; Intensive Care Units/st [Standards]; Male; Michigan; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic/is [Instrumentation]; Monitoring, Physiologic/mt [Methods]; Point-of-Care Systems; Pressure Ulcer/ep [Epidemiology]; Pressure Ulcer/et [Etiology]; Pressure/ae [Adverse Effects]; Prospective Studies; Tertiary Care Centers/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]; Young Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lack of continuous monitoring for average-risk patients has been suggested as a contributing factor for unexpected in-hospital mortality. Our objective was to assess the effects of continuous heart rate and respiration rate monitoring in a medical-surgical unit on unplanned transfers and length of stay in the intensive care unit and length of stay in the medical-surgical unit., METHODS: In a controlled study, we have compared a 33-bed medical-surgical unit (intervention unit) to a ""sister"" control unit for a 9-month preimplementation and a 9-month postimplementation period. Following the intervention, all beds in the intervention unit were equipped with monitors that allowed for continuous assessment of heart and respiration rate., RESULTS: We reviewed 7643 patient charts: 2314 that were continuously monitored in the intervention arm and 5329 in the control arms. Comparing the average length of stay of patients hospitalized in the intervention unit following the implementation of the monitors to that before the implementation and to that in the control unit, we observed a significant decrease (from 4.0 to 3.6 and 3.6 days, respectively; P <.05).

However, the condition ""ginseng abuse syndrome"" (GAS), defined as hypertension, nervousness, sleeplessness, skin eruption, and morning diarrhea, was coined as a result of a study of people who had been using a variety of ginseng preparations. However, we reported that administration of RGE increased rapid eye movement (REM) and non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep via GABAergic systems in animals. Therefore, this study was performed to investigate how red ginseng extract (RGE) affects sleeping behaviors in human volunteers., MATERIALS AND METHODS: RGE (1500 mg) was orally administered to young male healthy volunteers (from 15 to 37 years old ages, n=15) three times a day for 7 days. Overnight polysomnographic (PSG) studies were performed two times, 1 day before and 7 days after RGE administration. We investigated differences in sleep architecture parameters such as total sleep time (TST), sleep efficacy (SE: total sleep time/time in bed), proportion of each sleep stage, and wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO) between baseline PSG and PSG after RGE administration., RESULTS: Total wake time (TWT) was significantly reduced (P<0.05) and SE was increased (P<0.05), although slow wave sleep stage 1 (N1) was reduced (P<0.01) and non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was increased (P<0.03) after administration., CONCLUSION: From these results, it is presumed that RGE intake would improve the quality of sleep, thus having beneficial effects on sleep disturbed subjects.",2013,2022-08-24T07:19:26Z,2022-08-24T07:19:26Z,2013-01-01,597,NA,2,149,NA,Journal of ethnopharmacology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01122439,*Plant Extracts/pd [Pharmacology]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; Adolescent; Adult; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Panax; Polysomnography; Young Adult,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fifty-six healthy adolescents (25 males, age = 15-19 y) who studied in top high schools and were not habitual short sleepers were randomly assigned to Sleep Restriction (SR) or Control groups. Participants underwent a 2-w protocol consisting of 3 baseline nights (TIB = 9 h), 7 nights of sleep opportunity manipulation (TIB = 5 h for the SR and 9 h for the control groups), and 3 nights of recovery sleep (TIB = 9 h) at a boarding school.

In Parkinson's disease (PD), levodopa improves UA obstruction during wakefulness. We hypothesized that bedtime controlled-release levodopa (Sinemet CR) is associated with less severe OSA (lower apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) in PD patients., METHODS: Idiopathic PD subjects underwent nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) and were divided into those taking bedtime Sinemet CR (SinCR+) and those not taking Sinemet CR (SinCR-). Outcomes were compared between groups for PSG recordings analyzed in whole and split at their mid-point with each half analyzed separately, using linear regression., RESULTS: Fifty-seven subjects were studied, eight SinCR+, and 49 SinCR-. They were 65 % male, aged 64.4 ± 10.3 years (mean ± SD), with body mass index 27.26 ± 3.98 kg/m(2). The whole night AHI was 15.6 ± 13.3 and 29.1 ± 20.8 in SinCR+ and SinCR-, respectively (p = 0.07 unadjusted, p = 0.11 adjusted for confounders). A similar trend was observed in the first half of the night. In the second half, the SinCR+ group had significantly lower AHI (beta = -18.8; p = 0.01 adjusted) and respiratory arousal index (beta = -14.2; p = 0.02 adjusted) than the SinCR- group., CONCLUSIONS: Bedtime Sinemet CR appears to reduce OSA in PD patients. There were no significant differences between groups in the first half of the night likely because of residual effects of short-acting levodopa in both groups, while Sinemet CR had residual effect in the second half.

Moreover, it has been unclear whether PSD impacts impulse-related cognitive processes, and specifically if it differentially affects impulsive action versus impulsive decision-making. We sought to determine if short compared to long sleep (6 vs. 9h/night) impacts impulsive action via behavioral inhibition (Go/No-Go), and/or impulsive decision-making processes of risk taking (Balloon Analogue Risk Task [BART]) and preferences for immediate over delayed rewards (Delay Discounting). In a within-subject design, 34 participants (71% female, mean age=37.0years, SD=10.54) were assigned to four consecutive nights of 6h/night (short sleep) and 9h/night (long sleep) in their own home in random counterbalanced order. Sleep was measured via wrist-worn actigraphs to confirm adherence to the sleep schedules (mean short sleep=5.9h, SD=0.3; mean long sleep=8.6h, SD=0.3, p<0.001).

This effect was strongest in participants reporting longer habitual time in bed (p=0.04). There were no differences in performance following long- versus short-sleep for either delay discounting or the BART (p's>0.4). Overall, these results indicate that four days of PSD diminishes behavioral inhibition abilities, but may not alter impulsive decision-making. These findings contribute to the emerging understanding of how partial sleep deprivation, currently an epidemic, impacts cognitive ability. Future research should continue to explore the connection between PSD and cognitive functions, and ways to minimize the occurrence and negative consequences of short sleep.",2016,2022-08-24T07:19:26Z,2022-08-24T07:19:26Z,2016-01-01,214,NA,Pt A,164,NA,Physiology & behavior,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Publisher: Elsevier Inc.

The current investigation looked to evaluate a practical sleep hygiene strategy (10-min showering at ∼40°C before lights out), within a group of 11 youth soccer players in comparison to normal sleeping conditions (control). Each condition consisted of three days within a randomised crossover trial design. Sleep information was collected using a commercial wireless bedside sleep monitor. Measures of skin temperature were evaluated using iButton skin thermistors to establish both distal and proximal skin temperatures and distal to proximal gradient. The shower intervention elevated distal skin temperature by 1.1°C (95% CI: 0.1-2.1°C, p = .04) on average prior to lights out. The elevation in distal temperature was also present during the first 30-min following lights out (1.0°C, 95% CI: 0.4-1.6°C, p < .01). The distal to proximal gradient also showed a significant effect between the conditions within the first 30-min after lights out (0.7°C, 95% CI: 0.3-1.2°C, p < .01). On average the sleep latency of the youth soccer players was -7-min lower (95% CI: -13 to -2 min, p < .01) and sleep efficiency +2% higher (95% CI: 1-3%; p < .01) in the shower condition.

The current study examined changes in sleep variability in the course of brief behavioral therapy for insomnia (BBT-I) in older adults who had chronic insomnia. Additionally, the current study examined the mediating mechanisms underlying reductions of sleep variability and the moderating effects of baseline sleep variability on treatment responsiveness., METHODS: Sixty-two elderly participants were randomly assigned to either BBT-I or self-monitoring and attention control (SMAC). Sleep was assessed by sleep diaries and actigraphy from baseline to posttreatment and at 3-month follow-up. Mixed models were used to examine changes in sleep variability (within-person standard deviations of weekly sleep parameters) and the hypothesized mediation and moderation effects., RESULTS: Variabilities in sleep diary-assessed sleep onset latency (SOL) and actigraphy-assessed total sleep time (TST) significantly decreased in BBT-I compared to SMAC (Pseudo R2 = .12, .27; P = .018, .008). These effects were mediated by reductions in bedtime and wake time variability and time in bed. Significant time × group × baseline sleep variability interactions on sleep outcomes indicated that participants who had higher baseline sleep variability were more responsive to BBT-I; their actigraphy-assessed TST, SOL, and sleep efficiency improved to a greater degree (Pseudo R2 = .15 to .66; P < .001 to .044)., CONCLUSIONS: BBT-I is effective in reducing sleep variability in older adults who have chronic insomnia. Increased consistency in bedtime and wake time and decreased time in bed mediate reductions of sleep variability.

In a single-center study in the sleep laboratory at the University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, 18 patients with PD and EDS (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score >10) were screened in the sleep laboratory. Five patients were excluded owing to the polysomnographic diagnosis of sleep apnea and 1 patient withdrew consent. Thus, 12 patients were randomized to a treatment sequence (sodium oxybate followed by placebo or placebo followed by sodium oxybate, ratio 1:1) and, after dropout of 1 patient owing to an unrelated adverse event during the washout period, 11 patients completed the study. Two patients developed obstructive sleep apnea during sodium oxybate treatment (1 was the dropout) and were excluded from the per-protocol analysis (n = 10) but included in the intention-to-treat analysis (n = 12)., Interventions: Nocturnal sodium oxybate and placebo taken at bedtime and 2.5 to 4.0 hours later with an individually titrated dose between 3.0 and 9.0 g per night for 6 weeks with a 2- to 4-week washout period interposed., Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome measure was change of objective EDS as electrophysiologically measured by mean sleep latency in the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Secondary outcome measures included change of subjective EDS (ESS), sleep quality (Parkinson Disease Sleep Scale-2), and objective variables of nighttime sleep (polysomnography)., Results: Among 12 patients in the intention-to-treat population (10 men, 2 women; mean [SD] age, 62 [11.1] years; disease duration, 8.4 [4.6] years), sodium oxybate substantially improved EDS as measured objectively (mean sleep latency, +2.9 minutes; 95% CI, 2.1 to 3.8 minutes; P = .002) and subjectively (ESS score, -4.2 points ; 95% CI, -5.3 to -3.0 points; P = .001). Thereby, 8 (67%) patients exhibited an electrophysiologically defined positive treatment response. Moreover, sodium oxybate significantly enhanced subjective sleep quality and objectively measured slow-wave sleep duration (+72.7 minutes; 95% CI, 55.7 to 89.7 minutes; P < .001). Differences were more pronounced in the per-protocol analysis. Sodium oxybate was generally well tolerated under dose adjustments (no treatment-related dropouts), but it induced de novo obstructive sleep apnea in 2 patients and parasomnia in 1 patient, as detected by polysomnography, all of whom did not benefit from sodium oxybate treatment., Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides class I evidence for the efficacy of sodium oxybate in treating EDS and nocturnal sleep disturbance in patients with PD.

To properly analyze such data and extract clinical knowledge, noise componentsmust be removed or alleviated. In this paper a pre-processing and subsequent sleep staging pipeline for the sleep analysis of electroencephalographic signals is described. Two novel methods of functional connectivity estimation (Synchronization Likelihood/SL and Relative Wavelet Entropy/RWE) are comparatively investigated for automatic sleep staging through manually pre-processed electroencephalographic recordings. A multi-step process that renders signals suitable for further analysis is initially described. Then, two methods that rely on extracting synchronization features from electroencephalographic recordings to achieve computerized sleep staging are proposed, based on bivariate features which provide a functional overview of the brain network, contrary to most proposed methods that rely on extracting univariate time and frequency features. Annotation of sleep epochs is achieved through the presented feature extraction methods by training classifiers, which are in turn able to accurately classify new epochs. Analysis of data from sleep experiments on a randomized, controlled bed-rest study, which was organized by the European Space Agency and was conducted in the “ENVIHAB” facility of the Institute of Aerospace Medicine at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Cologne, Germany attains high accuracy rates, over 90% based on ground truth that resulted from manual sleep staging by two experienced sleep experts.

The sleep extension group significantly increased time in bed [0:55 hours:minutes (h:mm); 95% CI: 0:37, 1:12 h:mm], sleep period (0:47 h:mm; 95% CI: 0:29, 1:05 h:mm), and sleep duration (0:21 h:mm; 95% CI: 0:06, 0:36 h:mm) compared with the control group. Sleep extension led to reduced intake of free sugars (-9.6 g; 95% CI: -16.0, -3.1 g) compared with control (0.7 g; 95% CI: -5.7, 7.2 g) (P = 0.042). A sensitivity analysis in plausible reporters showed that the sleep extension group reduced intakes of fat (percentage), carbohydrates (grams), and free sugars (grams) in comparison to the control group. There were no significant differences between groups in markers of energy balance or cardiometabolic health. Conclusions: We showed the feasibility of extending sleep in adult short sleepers. Sleep extension led to reduced free sugar intakes and may be a viable strategy to facilitate limiting excessive consumption of free sugars in an obesity-promoting environment.

Yet, technology-related behaviors are often neglected in sleep hygiene education. This study examined whether the Sleep Treatment Education Program for Students-modified to include information regarding managing technology use (STEPS-TECH)-helps improve both subjective and objective sleep outcomes among university students. Results of an experimental study among 78 university students showed improvements in objective indicators of sleep quantity (total sleep time) and sleep quality (less awakenings) during the subsequent week for students in the STEPS-TECH intervention group compared to a control group. Exploratory analyses indicated that effects were driven by improvements in weekend days immediately following the intervention. There were also no intervention effects on subjective sleep quality or quantity outcomes. In terms of self-reported behavioral responses to educational content in the intervention, there were no group differences in sleep hygiene practices or technology use before bedtime.

METHODS: A total of 40 women aged 55 years or older with mild sleep impairment were randomized to either a treadmill walking session for 50 minutes or a quiet-rest control. All participants completed the study (mean age: 60.4 ± 4.7 years). Sleep quality was assessed by ActiGraph for 2 nights before (pretest) and 2 nights after exercise (posttest). A mixed-design analysis of variance was used with group as the between-subjects factor and time point as the within-subjects factor. RESULTS: No significant group difference in demographic variables, body mass index, physical and mental status, and eight sleep parameters were observed at baseline. Significant group-time interactions existed for sleep latency (P < .001) and sleep efficiency (P = .025). After the intervention, the walking group reduced sleep latency by 3.3 minutes (P = .001) and also had greater sleep efficiency (increase 3.8%, P = .008), but no significant change was found in the control group. No significant group-time interactions were present for the other six sleep parameters (activity counts, total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, number and length of awakenings, or time in bed).

We hypothesized that eating a late dinner alters substrate metabolism during sleep in a manner that promotes obesity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work is to examine the impact of late dinner on nocturnal metabolism in healthy volunteers. DESIGN AND SETTING: This is a randomized crossover trial of late dinner (LD, 22:00) vs routine dinner (RD, 18:00), with a fixed sleep period (23:00-07:00) in a laboratory setting. PARTICIPANTS: Participants comprised 20 healthy volunteers (10 male, 10 female), age 26.0 ± 0.6 years, body mass index 23.2 ± 0.7 kg/m2, accustomed to a bedtime between 22:00 and 01:00. INTERVENTIONS: An isocaloric macronutrient diet was administered on both visits. Dinner (35% daily kcal, 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat) with an oral lipid tracer ([2H31] palmitate, 15 mg/kg) was given at 18:00 with RD and 22:00 with LD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements included nocturnal and next-morning hourly plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acids (FFAs), cortisol, dietary fatty acid oxidation, and overnight polysomnography. RESULTS: LD caused a 4-hour shift in the postprandial period, overlapping with the sleep phase. Independent of this shift, the postprandial period following LD was characterized by higher glucose, a triglyceride peak delay, and lower FFA and dietary fatty acid oxidation. LD did not affect sleep architecture, but increased plasma cortisol. These metabolic changes were most pronounced in habitual earlier sleepers determined by actigraphy monitoring. CONCLUSION: LD induces nocturnal glucose intolerance, and reduces fatty acid oxidation and mobilization, particularly in earlier sleepers. These effects might promote obesity if they recur chronically.",2020,2022-08-24T07:19:28Z,2022-08-24T07:19:28Z,2020-01-01,NA,NA,8,105,NA,Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-02140576,"*Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/me [Metabolism]; *Feeding Behavior/ph [Physiology]; *Glucose Intolerance/et [Etiology]; *Meals/ph [Physiology]; *Obesity/pc [Prevention & Control]; Adolescent; Adult; Blood Glucose/an [Analysis]; Blood Glucose/me [Metabolism]; Cross-Over Studies; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/bl [Blood]; Female; Glucose Intolerance/bl [Blood]; Glucose Intolerance/di [Diagnosis]; Glucose Intolerance/me [Metabolism]; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Hydrocortisone/bl [Blood]; Insulin/bl [Blood]; Male; Obesity/et [Etiology]; Obesity/me [Metabolism]; Obesity/pp [Physiopathology]; Oxidation-Reduction; Polysomnography; Sleep/ph [Physiology]; Time Factors; Triglycerides/bl [Blood]; Young Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

RBD as a premotor feature occurred souvent in patients who develop Parkinson's disease. The glutamatergic, glycinergic, and GABA-ergic systems appear to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of RBD., METHODS: The present exploratory longitudinal cross-over study aimed to observe the effect of safinamide on RBD symptoms. Thirty patients with PD and RBD were randomized into two groups (15 subjects each), those that received for a period of 3-months safinamide (50 mg/die) in addition (Group A + ) or in absence (Group B - ) to the usual antiparkinsonian therapy. Patients exploring the clinical and video-polysomnographic changes occurred during this pharmacological therapy., RESULTS: Twenty-two of 30 patients reported clear improvement in symptoms during safinamide treatment, and 16 were absolutely free from clinical RBD-symptoms at the end of the treatment. Eight patients reported slight improvement in RBD-symptoms. In 6/30 patients no substantial improvement was recorded about clinical RBD-symptoms had frightening dreams or from the bed after 1-week of treatment.

Results were compared with the IVC diameter obtained in 33 healthy controls (16 women, 42 +/- 15 years).

The IVC diameter decreased continuously and significantly (p < 0.003) from day 1 to day 10 during diuretic therapy without a concomitant rise in serum creatinine. At beginning of therapy, the collapse-index of the IVC was significantly greater in patients than in controls. However, after 10 days of therapy this index reached similar values to those observed in controls., CONCLUSION: Ultrasonographic measurements of IVC diameter and inspiratory movements are a quantifiable and reliable approach to assess the hypervolemia associated with CHF.

The aims were: 1) to characterize this pain generally in terms of intensity, frequency, duration, and behavior across a period of 2 weeks; 2) to identify main intraday pain patterns and to examine whether subgroups of patients in this respect differed in clinical, demographic, pain and sleep variables, psychosocial factors, and use of medication; and 3) to investigate some possible interday trends of pain intensity at a group level., METHOD: One hundred thirty-three patients with myogenous temporomandibular disorders completed a 2-week diary, rating pain intensity (100 mm Visual Analog Scale [VAS]), duration, behavior (verbal 6-point scale), and medication use on 4 times of the day. Furthermore, questionnaires were completed to score pain period before seeking treatment, spread of pain, and demographic, psychosocial, and sleep variables., RESULTS: In the diary, pain intensity, frequency, daily pain duration, and the score of pain behavior were on average 29.1 mm, 69% of the scoring times, 5.5 hours, and 1.8 points (approaching ""pain present, but I can ignore it at times""), respectively. Pain intensity was, on average, maximal late in the day (before dinner or bedtime) for the majority of patients (79%) and early in the day (before breakfast or lunchtime) for the minority (21%). The larger subgroup had a significantly higher daily pain intensity, more frequently a widespread pain and problems with falling asleep at bedtime, agreed more about the role of a physician as an external health locus of control, and had a more distancing coping style. Both subgroups were similar for other variables, most notably in the level of state anxiety and depressive mood, and in a sparse use (7.8% of all possible times) of over-the-counter medication. Daily mean VAS scores, averaged across patients, were approximately constant for the various diary days. Both the daily mean and maximal VAS score were not related to a specific day of the week., CONCLUSIONS: Two main daily pain patterns occur in patients with myogenous temporomandibular disorders (79%: maximal pain late in the day; 21%: early in the day), which might be related to differences in processes that influence pain sensitivity and patterns of jaw muscle activation. The interday similarities in pain level suggest that a sustained influence of counseling after the intake or an influence of a common behavioral pattern with a cycle duration of a week are not involved.",2005,2022-08-24T07:19:29Z,2022-08-24T07:19:29Z,2005-01-01,154,NA,2,21,NA,Clinical journal of pain,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00502625,"*Facial Pain/di [Diagnosis]; *Facial Pain/ep [Epidemiology]; *Pain Measurement/mt [Methods]; *Temporomandibular Joint Disorders/ep [Epidemiology]; Adult; Causality; Comorbidity; Facial Pain/cl [Classification]; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Medical Records/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]; Middle Aged; Netherlands/ep [Epidemiology]; Pattern Recognition, Automated/mt [Methods]; Periodicity; Recurrence; Severity of Illness Index; Temporomandibular Joint Disorders/cl [Classification]; Temporomandibular Joint Disorders/di [Diagnosis]; Time Factors",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These transmitter systems are closely related to the regulation of sleep., METHOD: The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover study was to investigate the effects of ziprasidone on polysomnographic sleep structure and subjective sleep quality. Twelve healthy male subjects were randomly assigned to receive ziprasidone 40 mg or placebo for 2 sessions each composed of 2 consecutive nights (night 1, standard sleep conditions; night 2, acoustic stress) 5 days apart. Treatment was administered orally 2 hours before bedtime. The study was conducted from April 2004 to July 2004., RESULTS: Ziprasidone significantly increased total sleep time, sleep efficiency, percentage of sleep stage 2, and slow wave sleep; decreased the number of awakenings; and significantly affected tonic and phasic REM sleep parameters, i.e., it decreased percentage of REM and REM density and profoundly increased REM latency., CONCLUSION: Ziprasidone's effects on the sleep profile are somehow opposite to what is known about sleep of depressed patients (e.g., disturbances of sleep continuity, a reduciton of slow wave sleep, and a disinhibition of REM sleep). Its REM sleep-suppressing properties resemble those of most, although not all, antidepressants and may be clinically relevant. The drug also demonstrates sleep-consolidating properties under both standard routine and acoustic stress conditions. These effects are most likely related to ziprasidone's 5-HT(2C) antagonism, 5-HT(1A) agonism, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.",2005,2022-08-24T07:19:29Z,2022-08-24T07:19:29Z,2005-01-01,989,NA,8,66,NA,Journal of clinical psychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00523724,"*Antipsychotic Agents/pd [Pharmacology]; *Piperazines/pd [Pharmacology]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; *Thiazoles/pd [Pharmacology]; Acoustic Stimulation/mt [Methods]; Acoustic Stimulation/px [Psychology]; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Electroencephalography/de [Drug Effects]; Humans; Male; Placebos; Polysomnography/de [Drug Effects]; Sleep Stages/de [Drug Effects]; Sleep, REM/de [Drug Effects]; Stress, Psychological/et [Etiology]; Stress, Psychological/px [Psychology]; Surveys and Questionnaires",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we evaluate the safety and possible treatment effect of adding further stiffness to the palate through the use of a more rigid implant., STUDY DESIGN: Randomized double-blind study of 20 patients with primary snoring. Three polyethylene teralphate implants were placed in the soft palate with the patient under local anesthesia. Ten patients received regular implants (rigidity 1.0) and 10 patients received stiffer implants (rigidity 1.8). The patients and their bed partners were followed for 6 months with questionnaires and office visits. A sleep study was performed preoperatively and at the last follow-up., RESULTS: Four of the 10 patients with stiffer implants had 5 partial extrusions in the observation period. There was a nonsignificant reduction in snoring intensity from 8.1 to 6.1 evaluated by the bed partner on a visual analogue scale in this group. No extrusions were seen in the group with regular implants. This group showed a significant reduction in snoring intensity from 7.7 to 4.7. No other major adverse events were observed., CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Rigid implants cause short time extrusions with loss of treatment effect. Regular implants reduce palatal snoring intensity with high patient and bed partner satisfaction.

A total of 20 smokers (9 women and 11 men) smoking at least 20 cigarettes/day completed the two smoke-free study periods. For each period, cigarette abstinence started on the first evening and a nicotine patch was applied the next morning (for 16 or 24 hr), after baseline measures; a second patch was applied the next morning, 1 hr before the end of the experimental period. Smoking urges, mood and behavior self-reports, psychomotor performance, and polysomnographic recordings were compared between the two types of nicotine patch according to changes from baseline. Both patches decreased morning smoking urges, although results were significantly superior for the 24-hr patch. Furthermore, the 24-hr patch was more effective than the 16-hr patch in reducing the positive reinforcing dimension of smoking urges. Regarding polysomnographic recordings, the proportion of slow wave sleep was significantly increased from baseline with the 24-hr patch compared with the 16-hr patch. As for psychomotor performance measured through the critical flicker fusion test, significant improvement in morning alertness was observed in the 24-hr patch group. In conclusion, the 24-hr nicotine patch formulation is more effective than the 16-hr formulation in alleviating morning smoking urges and more specifically the positive reinforcing factor. The present findings do not support the idea that nicotine delivery during bedtime might disturb sleep, but rather it improves restorative sleep and postwaking arousal.",2006,2022-08-24T07:19:29Z,2022-08-24T07:19:29Z,2006-01-01,193,NA,2,8,NA,Nicotine & tobacco research,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00565797,"*Nicotine/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Nicotinic Agonists/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; *Smoking Cessation/mt [Methods]; *Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Tobacco Use Disorder/dt [Drug Therapy]; Administration, Cutaneous; Adult; Cross-Over Studies; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polysomnography; Statistics, Nonparametric; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/pc [Prevention & Control]; Treatment Outcome",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Caffeine also has effects on sleep. However, little is known about the interaction between sleep deprivation, circadian timing, and caffeine consumption on sleep. In this study, we compared the effects of caffeine on nocturnal sleep initiated at habitual circadian time and on daytime recovery sleep. Thirty-four moderate caffeine consumers participated in both caffeine (200 mg) and placebo (lactose) conditions in a double-blind crossover design. Seventeen subjects followed their habitual sleep-wake cycle and slept in the laboratory during the night (Night), while 17 subjects were sleep deprived for one night and recovery sleep started in the morning (DayRec). All subjects received a capsule of 100 mg of caffeine (or placebo) 3 h before bedtime, and the remaining dose 1 h before bedtime. Compared to placebo, caffeine lengthened sleep latency, increased stage 1, and reduced stage 2 and slow-wave sleep (SWS) in both groups. However, caffeine reduced sleep efficiency more strongly in the DayRec group, and decreased sleep duration and REM sleep only in that group. The stronger effects of caffeine on daytime recovery sleep compared to nocturnal sleep are probably the consequence of the combined influence of increasing circadian wake propensity drive and the dissipation of homeostatic sleep pressure. We propose that the reduction of SWS by caffeine during daytime sleep increases the impact of the circadian wake signal on sleep. These results have implications for individuals using caffeine during night time.",2007,2022-08-24T07:19:29Z,2022-08-24T07:19:29Z,2007-01-01,964,NA,4,32,NA,Neuropsychopharmacology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00576420,*Caffeine/pd [Pharmacology]; *Central Nervous System Stimulants/pd [Pharmacology]; *Sleep Deprivation/ci [Chemically Induced]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; *Wakefulness/de [Drug Effects]; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Caffeine/me [Metabolism]; Central Nervous System Stimulants/me [Metabolism]; Circadian Rhythm/de [Drug Effects]; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Polysomnography/mt [Methods]; Reaction Time/de [Drug Effects]; Saliva/me [Metabolism],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Subjects first received baseline polysomnography and, upon awakening, subjective scales of drowsiness and functioning. One to 2 weeks later, they returned to the sleep lab. They consumed 4 ounces of 40% alcohol and gabapentin (300 or 600 mg) or placebo 1 hour prior to bedtime. Polysomnography and subjective scales were repeated. One to 2 weeks later, subjects returned and were given the same dose of alcohol and the other treatment, followed by repeat testing.

Because it has no depressant effects on the nervous system, it is not expected to affect the control of breathing. The potential effects of ramelteon on apneic and hypopneic events and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea were assessed. In this double-blind, randomized, crossover study, 26 adults with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea received ramelteon 16 mg and placebo for one night each, with a 5- to 12-day washout period between treatments. Treatments were administered 30 min before habitual bedtime. Respiratory effort was monitored using respiratory inductance plethysmography, SaO(2) was measured by pulse oximetry, and sleep onset and duration were measured by polysomnography and post-sleep questionnaire. Post-sleep questionnaire also measured next-day residual effects. The primary measure was apnea-hypopnea index. Apnea-hypopnea index was similar in ramelteon and placebo groups (11.4 vs 11.1, respectively; CI = -2.1, 2.6, P = 0.812).

Six male subjects (mean age +/- SD, 28.1 +/- 7.1 yr) had their arousal response tested by occluding a mask covering the nose with the mouth sealed. After an adaptation night, subjects were studied on two consecutive nights. They ingested triazolam (0.25 mg) or placebo one-half hour before bedtime in a randomized double-blind crossover manner. Mask occlusion was performed 1 to 4 h after triazolam/placebo ingestion while the subjects breathed a mixture of air and oxygen adjusted to produce an arterial oxygen saturation of 98%. The maximal deflections in airway pressure were measured at a supraglottic location during airway occlusion to reflect the degree of inspiratory effort. The time to arousal (mean +/- SEM) was significantly longer on triazolam nights (32.0 +/- 5.2 versus 22.6 +/- 3.2 s, p < 0.01).

Compared with placebo, latency to persistent sleep after both zaleplon and zolpidem was shorter and total sleep time after administration of the drugs was longer (overall p < .001, Dunnett p < .001 for all posthoc comparisons). Significant differences from placebo were not found with zaleplon in daytime-sedation measures. At 4, 5, and 7 hours after zolpidem, sleep onset on sleep latency testing was shorter than after placebo (overall p < .001 for all, Dunnett tests for posthoc comparisons p < .001, p < .001, p < .05, respectively). Self-report measures of concentration (4, 5, and 6 hours, overall p < .05, Dunnett p < .05 for each time point) and alertness (4 hours, overall p < .05, Dunnett p < .05), and Digit Symbol Substitution Test scores (4 and 5 hours, overall p < .001, Dunnett p < .01 for both time points) after zolpidem were also lower than with placebo., CONCLUSIONS: Zaleplon 10 mg and zolpidem 10 mg effectively shorten sleep latency and lengthen sleep duration after dosing, when administered during experimental nocturnal awakening. Residual sedation was not detected as little as 4 hours after zaleplon 10 mg, whereas residual sedation was detected with zolpidem 10 mg up to 7 hours after treatment. These findings suggest that zaleplon may be an appropriate treatment for use when patients awaken during the night and have difficulty reinitiating sleep.",2006,2022-08-24T07:19:30Z,2022-08-24T07:19:30Z,2006-01-01,417,NA,4,2,NA,Journal of clinical sleep medicine,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00705973,"*Acetamides/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Hypnotics and Sedatives/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Pyridines/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Pyrimidines/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm/di [Diagnosis]; *Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm/dt [Drug Therapy]; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polysomnography; Treatment Outcome; Wakefulness; Zolpidem",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When both swaddled and unswaddled, arousability was assessed with a pulsatile jet of air at the nostrils., RESULTS: Larger increases in overall arousal thresholds (SCA plus CA) with swaddling were observed in infants who were easiest to arouse when unswaddled. Swaddling did not alter SCA or CA frequencies of routinely swaddled infants at either age. In infants who were naïve to swaddling, arousal thresholds were increased and CA frequency decreased during swaddled quiet sleep at 3 months., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a scientific basis for assessing the safety of swaddling in infant care practice.

Quetiapine has been demonstrated in open-label trials to be effective for the treatment of insomnia and VH in PD. To confirm quetiapine's efficacy in improving VH, and to determine whether the mechanism was due to its effect on REM sleep architecture, we performed a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Sixteen PD patients experiencing VH were recruited. Eight patients were randomized to quetiapine and eight patients to placebo. Patients underwent pre- and post-treatment polysomnography. The Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor subscale were obtained. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the treatment arms except that the placebo group had more sleep in stage REM (74.7 min vs. 40.1 min; p < .001). Data were imputed for all patients who prematurely discontinued (four quetiapine and one placebo) in an intention-to-treat analysis. The average quetiapine dose was 58.3 mg/day. While there was no significant difference in the change in REM duration pre- vs. post-treatment in either arm, patients randomized to quetiapine improved on the CGIS (p = .03) and the hallucination item of the BPRS (p = .02).

Bed-wetting occurred within each sleep stage and did not follow any particular pattern. In most cases, it was preceded by an arousal reaction, but no awakening occurred., CONCLUSION: DDAVP has no effect on the sleep architecture of children with PME when analysed by classical PSG, which is determined by collecting the electric activity of cortical neurons.

Two previous controlled trials have published conflicting results regarding the effects of palatal implants on objective outcome measures, although they both could demonstrate superiority over placebo. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of palatal implants in patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty-two patients with mild to moderate OSA (AHI 18 ± 5, BMI 28 ± 3, age 51 ± 13 years) due to palatal obstruction were enrolled in this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Respiratory parameters and sleep efficiency (evaluated by polysomnography), snoring (evaluated by the bed partner), and daytime sleepiness (evaluated by ESS) were assessed before and 90 days after surgery. One patient in each group did not show up for follow-up. The AHI, HI and LSAT showed statistically significant improvement in the treatment group (p < 0.05). Snoring as rated by bed partners also showed statistically significant improvement within the treatment group (p = 0.025). There was no statistical difference when comparing the means of the treatment group with the placebo group. There were no peri- or post-operative complications and no extrusions during the follow-up period.

They had a range of neurological and developmental disorders and a severe sleep problem that had not responded to a standardised sleep behaviour advice booklet provided to parents four to six weeks before randomisation. A sleep problem was defined as the child not falling asleep within one hour of lights out or having less than six hours' continuous sleep., INTERVENTIONS: Immediate release melatonin or matching placebo capsules administered 45 minutes before the child's bedtime for a period of 12 weeks. All children started with a 0.5 mg capsule, which was increased through 2 mg, 6 mg, and 12 mg depending on their response to treatment., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total sleep time at night after 12 weeks adjusted for baseline recorded in sleep diaries completed by the parent. Secondary outcomes included sleep onset latency, assessments of child behaviour, family functioning, and adverse events. Sleep was measured with diaries and actigraphy., RESULTS: Melatonin increased total sleep time by 22.4 minutes (95% confidence interval 0.5 to 44.3 minutes) measured by sleep diaries (n=110) and 13.3 (-15.5 to 42.2) measured by actigraphy (n=59). Melatonin reduced sleep onset latency measured by sleep diaries (-37.5 minutes, -55.3 to -19.7 minutes) and actigraphy (-45.3 minutes, -68.8 to -21.9 minutes) and was most effective for children with the longest sleep latency (P=0.009). Melatonin was associated with earlier waking times than placebo (29.9 minutes, 13.6 to 46.3 minutes). Child behaviour and family functioning outcomes showed some improvement and favoured use of melatonin. Adverse events were mild and similar between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: Children gained little additional sleep on melatonin; though they fell asleep significantly faster, waking times became earlier.

Data were available for analysis in eight subjects (seven males and one female; mean age, 10 yrs ± SD 5; range, 2-16 yrs) during 18 protocol sessions. This resulted in a total of 66 head-of-the-bed challenges. To compare results for a given change in head-of-the-bed elevation across age, we transformed head-of-the-bed angle to change in height (cm) at the level of Monro's foramen. An increase in head elevation of 10 cm resulted in an average change in intracranial pressure of -3.9 mm Hg (SD ± 3.2 mm Hg; p < .001), whereas cerebral perfusion pressure remained unchanged (0.1 ± 5.6 mm Hg; p = .957). Individual subjects showed marked variability in intracranial pressure change (range, -8.4 to +1.9 mm Hg/10 cm). The overall regression analysis for intracranial pressure response was change in intracranial pressure = -0.39/cm &Dgr;h, r2 = 0.42, and p < .001, where &Dgr;h is the change in vertical height at the level of foramen of Monro attributable to a change in the head of the bed., CONCLUSIONS: In severe pediatric traumatic brain injury, the relationship between change in head of the bed and change in intracranial pressure was negative and linear. The lowest intracranial pressure was usually, but not always, achieved at highest head-of-the-bed angles. The effect size of a head-of-the-bed angle change depended, in part, on the subject's height. In contrast, cerebral perfusion pressure was mostly unaffected by head-of-the-bed changes.",2012,2022-08-24T07:19:31Z,2022-08-24T07:19:31Z,2012-01-01,e39,NA,1,13,NA,Pediatric critical care medicine,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00972822,"*Brain Injuries/th [Therapy]; *Cerebrovascular Circulation/ph [Physiology]; *Critical Care/mt [Methods]; *Intracranial Pressure/ph [Physiology]; Beds; Brain Injuries/di [Diagnosis]; Brain Injuries/mo [Mortality]; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glasgow Coma Scale; Humans; Infant; Intensive Care Units, Pediatric; Linear Models; Male; Monitoring, Physiologic/mt [Methods]; Posture; Prospective Studies; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When mothers hold or cuddle their infants they create a microenvironment with stimuli similar to those of the intrauterine environment. Several of these same stimuli were incorporated into a cradle designed to provide a similar ""holding"" environment for the infant when the mother was not there. Ninety healthy term newborn infants were randomized to an experimental (n = 45) or control group (n = 45). The experimental group used a cradle that produced motion, sound, tactile (containment), and reduced-light stimuli at stimulus levels that initially approximated intrauterine sensory stimulation levels and gradually decreased to the levels of the home environment over 16 weeks. The control group used an identical cradle with no stimulus modulation features. Infants were placed in their respective cradles from 2 hours after birth during the times they would normally be placed in an infant bed. The mother-infant interaction or parenting style was not changed or manipulated. Mothers' use of the cradles did not differ significantly. An electronic status monitor measured and recorded infant presence and crying in the cradles. The Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale test was done at 1 to 2, 14, and 24 days of age by ""blinded"" examiners.

The consequences of falls can be severe, both for the individual and for the caring institution., OBJECTIVE: The aim of the work presented here is to reduce the number of falls on a geriatric ward by monitoring patients more closely. To achieve this goal, a bed-exit alarm that reliably detects an attempt to get up has been constructed., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A requirements analysis revealed the nurses' and physicians' needs and preferences. Based on the gathered information, an incremental design process generated different prototypes. These were tested for the reliability of their ability to detect attempts to get up in both laboratory settings and with geriatric patients. Based on the result of these tests, a scalable technical solution has been developed and proven its reliability in a 1-year, randomized controlled pilot clinical trial on a geriatric ward., RESULTS: The developed system is unobtrusive and easy to deploy. It has been tested in laboratory settings, usability tests and a 1-year randomized clinical trial with 98 patients. This paper focuses on the technical development of the system. We present different prototypes, the experiments and the pilot study used to evaluate their performance. Last but not least, we discuss the lessons learned so far., CONCLUSION: The developed bed-exit alarm is able to reliably detect patients' attempts to get up. The results of the clinical trial show that the system is able to reduce the number of falls on a geriatric ward. Next steps are the design of a specialized sensor node that is easier to use and can be applied on an even larger scale due to its reduced cost.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that rostral fluid displacement from the legs causes a greater decrease in UA cross-sectional area (UA-XSA) and a greater increase in UA mucosal water content (UA-MWC) and internal jugular venous volume (IJVVol) in subjects with OSA than in those without OSA. Methods: Subjects underwent baseline assessment of leg fluid volume (LFV) measured by bio-electrical impedance, as well as UA-XSA and UA-MWC by magnetic resonance imaging. They were then randomly assigned to a 20-min period either with or without application of lower body positive pressure (LBPP) of 40 mm Hg, followed by a 15-min washout period, after which they crossed over to the other arm of the study. Measurements of LFV, UA-MWC, and UA-XSA were repeated after each arm of the study. Results: In 12 subjects without sleep apnea, UA-XSA increased and UA-MWC decreased significantly, whereas in 12 subjects with OSA, UA-XSA decreased and UA-MWC increased significantly in response to LBPP. The changes in UA-XSA and UA-MWC in response to LBPP differed significantly between the 2 groups (p = 0.006 and p < 0.001, respectively), despite similar changes in LFV and IJVVol. Conclusions: Our results suggest that rostral fluid shift may contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA at least partly through narrowing of the UA due to transudation of fluid into the UA mucosa.",2014,2022-08-24T07:19:32Z,2022-08-24T07:19:32Z,2014-01-01,1069,NA,10,10,NA,Journal of clinical sleep medicine,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2510 N.

Many aspects of neonatal intensive care environments such as handling for routine and invasive procedures, bright lighting, and noise can create stress, disrupt behavior, and interfere with sleep in prematurely born infants. The study empirically investigated whether a 30-minute observation of infant sleep states and behavior could differentiate an intervention to promote sleep in premature infants with feeding difficulties relative to conventional care (standard positioning, standard crib mattress [SP]). We included an intervention to determine the ability of the method to discriminate treatments and generate a benchmark for future improvements. The intervention, a conformational positioner (CP), is contoured around the infant to provide customized containment and boundaries. To more fully verify the 30-minute observational sleep results, standard polysomnography was conducted simultaneously and sleep outcomes for the 2 modalities were compared., SUBJECTS: In a randomized crossover clinical trial, 25 infants, 31.5 ± 0.6 weeks' gestational age and 38.4 ± 0.6 weeks at the study, with gastrointestinal conditions or general feeding difficulties used each intervention during an overnight neonatal intensive care unit sleep study., METHODS: Infant sleep states and behaviors were observed during two 30-minute periods--that is, on the positioner and mattress--using the naturalistic observation of newborn behavior. Two certified developmental care nurses assessed sleep state, self-regulatory, and stress behaviors during 2-minute intervals and summed over 30 minutes. Sleep characteristics from standard polysomnography were measured at the time of behavior observations., RESULTS: Infants on CP spent significantly less time in alert, active awake, or crying states by observation compared with SP. Surgical subjects spent more time awake, active awake, or crying and displayed a higher number of behavior state changes than the nonsurgical infants. The percentage of time in observed deep sleep and quiet sleep was correlated with both percentage sleep efficiency (r = 0.78) and fewer state shifts per hour (r = -0.65) from electroencephalogram (EEG). Sleep efficiency by EEG was greater on CP versus SP., CONCLUSIONS: The CP enabled sleep compared with the standard mattress (SP) over 30-minute observation periods. Sleep status from behavioral observation was verified by standard EEG-based sleep techniques. Behavioral observation of sleep states may be a useful strategy for measuring the effectiveness of strategies to facilitate sleep in premature infants. Surgical subjects may benefit from additional interventions to promote sleep.",2015,2022-08-24T07:19:32Z,2022-08-24T07:19:32Z,2015-01-01,70,NA,1,15,NA,Advances in neonatal care,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01078249,"*Observation/mt [Methods]; *Patient Positioning/mt [Methods]; Beds; Cross-Over Studies; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Pilot Projects; Polysomnography; Sleep",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we test whether lengthening sleep via early bedtimes affects dietary intake differently for adolescents accustomed to a later sleep phase (""night owls"") versus an earlier sleep phase (""morning larks""). Methods Using a randomized cross-over design, 67 adolescents changed bedtimes to create five-night periods of sleep restriction (6.5 hours in bed) versus healthy sleep (10 hours in bed). Caloric intake was measured via validated interviews. Phase preference was based on participants' premanipulation sleep. Results Actigraphy verified that the manipulation altered sleep regardless of phase preference. Phase preference moderated the effect of the manipulation on cumulative caloric intake (p =.01-.03).

Alcohol depresses both hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory drives in awake, normal individuals and reduces the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and oxygen saturation (SpO2) in sleeping COPD subjects., METHODS: Prospectively designed, open-label interventional study in a pulmonary rehabilitation hospital. Twenty-six (nine males) stable inpatients, median forced expiratory volume first second (FEV1) 40.5 % of predicted, median age 65 years, investigated by polysomnography including transcutaneous measurement of carbon dioxide pressure increase (&Dgr;PtcCO2) in randomized order of either control sleep or intervention with 0.5 g of ethanol/kilogram bodyweight, taken orally immediately before lights off., RESULTS: Alcohol induced a mean increase (95 % confidence interval, [CI]) in the mean &Dgr;PtcCO2 of 0.10 kPa (0.002-0.206, P = 0.047) and a mean decrease (CI) in the REM-sleep percentage of total sleep time (REM % of TST) of 3.1 % (0.2-6.0), (P = 0.020). Six subjects with apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) ≥15 had fewer apneas/hypopneas during alcohol versus control sleep (mean reduction of AHI 11 (1-20), P = 0.046). Alcohol-sleep changes in SpO2, but not in &Dgr;PtcCO2, correlated with daytime arterial pressures of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and oxygen (PaO2)., CONCLUSION: Occasional use of a moderate, bedtime dose of alcohol has only minor respiratory depressant effects on the majority of COPD subjects, and in a minority even slightly improves respiration during sleep. However, caution is appropriate as this study is small and higher doses of alcohol may result in major respiratory depressive and additional negative health effects.",2015,2022-08-24T07:19:32Z,2022-08-24T07:19:32Z,2015-01-01,307,NA,1,19,NA,Schlaf & Atmung [Sleep & breathing],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01135208,"*Alcohol Drinking/ae [Adverse Effects]; *Alcohol Drinking/pp [Physiopathology]; *Oxygen/bl [Blood]; *Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/pp [Physiopathology]; *Respiratory Insufficiency/et [Etiology]; *Respiratory Insufficiency/pp [Physiopathology]; *Sleep Stages/de [Drug Effects]; *Sleep Stages/ph [Physiology]; Aged; Carbon Dioxide/bl [Blood]; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume/de [Drug Effects]; Forced Expiratory Volume/ph [Physiology]; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polysomnography/de [Drug Effects]; Prospective Studies",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study was a multicenter (n = 51), randomized, double-blind prospective clinical trial with a 10-week treatment period. Dose titration was performed by study investigators based on systolic and diastolic BP values at the doctor's office. Ambulatory BP monitoring was performed at placebo baseline, after 4 weeks of stable double-blind therapy, and at end of the study. Twenty-four-hour BP profiles were studied in 557 hypertensive patients. Changes in BP, HR, slope of the rate of rise of BP and HR, and the HR-systolic BP product during the 4 hours from 1 hour before to 3 hours after awakening were evaluated. The study was powered to show equivalence between the 2 regimens, predefined as a difference between treatment groups in mean change from baseline in early morning BP of +/- 5 mm Hg systolic and +/- 3 mm Hg diastolic. Changes in the early morning BP fell within the definition of equivalence for the 2 treatment strategies (-12.0/-8.2 mm Hg for COER-verapamil and -13.9/-7.3 mm Hg for nifedipine GITS). Changes in both the early morning HR and rate-pressure product were significantly greater following COER-verapamil therapy versus nifedipine GITS (HR, -3.8 beats/minute vs +2.6 beats/minute, p < 0.001 and HR-systolic BP product, -1,437 beats/min x mm Hg vs -703 beats/min x mm Hg, respectively, p < 0.001).

COER-verapamil and nifedipine GITS had equivalent effects (+/- 5/3 mm Hg) on early morning BP. In addition, both extended-release calcium antagonists effectively lowered 24-hour BP. However, COER-verapamil had greater effects than nifedipine GITS on early morning hemodynamics (HR, HR-systolic BP product, rate of rise of BP and HR) and lesser effects during sleep due to its intrinsic pharmacologic properties and chronotherapeutic delivery system.",1998,2022-08-24T07:19:33Z,2022-08-24T07:19:33Z,1998-01-01,424,NA,4,81,NA,American journal of cardiology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00147991,"*Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Nifedipine/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Verapamil/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Analysis of Variance; Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]; Chronotherapy; Delayed-Action Preparations; Double-Blind Method; Female; Heart Rate/de [Drug Effects]; Humans; Hypertension/pp [Physiopathology]; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Ambulatory",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As changes in core body temperature are generally associated with concomitant changes in sleep propensity, it is possible that the effects of hypnotic/soporific agents may be related to changes in thermoregulation. Therefore, to increase our knowledge of the mechanisms by which these agents exert their soporific effects, we compared the thermoregulatory and soporific effects of temazepam (20 mg per os (p.o.)) with those of melatonin (5 mg p.o.) when administered at 14.00 h to 20 young healthy adults (13 male, 7 female; age, 23.5 +/- 0.4 years). 2. From 08.00 to 20.30 h, subjects lay in bed, and foot and rectal (Tc) temperatures were recorded. Sleep onset latency (SOL) was measured using 20 min multiple sleep latency tests, performed hourly from 11.00 to 20.00 h, during which time heart rate was recorded. 3. Compared with placebo, both melatonin and temazepam significantly reduced Tc (-0.17 +/- 0.02 and -0.15 +/- 0.03 C, respectively) and SOL (by 4.8 +/- 1.49 and 6.5 +/- 1.62 min, respectively). Although both treatments significantly increased heat loss, only melatonin demonstrated cardiac effects. Importantly, there was a temporal relationship between minimum SOL and the maximum rate of decline in Tc for both melatonin (r = 0.48) and temazepam (r = 0.44). 4. A possible role of thermoregulation in sleep initiation is suggested by the similar temporal relationship between Tc and SOL for two different classes of soporific agents.",1999,2022-08-24T07:19:33Z,2022-08-24T07:19:33Z,1999-01-01,905,NA,NA,514 ( Pt 3),NA,Journal of physiology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00158779,*Anti-Anxiety Agents/pd [Pharmacology]; *Body Temperature/de [Drug Effects]; *Melatonin/pd [Pharmacology]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; *Temazepam/pd [Pharmacology]; Adolescent; Adult; Body Temperature Regulation/de [Drug Effects]; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Polysomnography; Sex Characteristics,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our aim was to study more extensively the effects of an oral anticholinergic drug on esophageal motility and gastroesophageal reflux in normal ambulant subjects under different circumstances: upright, supine, fed, and fasted state., METHODS: Fifteen healthy subjects (seven men, eight women), mean age 34 yr (range, 22-61 yr) underwent randomized placebo-controlled 16-h evening and overnight ambulatory esophageal motility/pH study. After a 3-day loading dose of either oral dicyclomine (Dic) 20 mg four times daily or placebo (Pla), an ambulatory esophageal motility/pH study was performed while taking medication or placebo. Each study was analyzed for meal, first and second h postprandial, upright and supine periods, and first 2 h supine after bedtime snack., RESULTS: The mean number of reflux episodes decreased with dicyclomine during the first h postprandial (Dic, 1.9 vs Pla, 2.5; p < 0.05). During the first 2 h supine, mean number of reflux episodes increased with dicyclomine (Dic, 1.4 vs Pla, 0.8; p < 0.09), as did mean percent time pH < 4 (Dic, 2.6 vs Pla, 0.5; p < 0.04), with an increase in clearance time (Dic, 0.9 vs Pla, 0.3; p < 0.05; in min). Mean peristaltic amplitude decreased with dicyclomine during the 2nd h postprandial (Dic, 48.8 vs Pla, 56.3; p < 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Oral dicyclomine caused a decrease in early postprandial upright reflux episodes, but also significantly increased the percent time pH < 4 during the first two h supine.

Methods: After screening, 45 children, ages 2.5 to 12.9 years, were randomized to order of mattress technology use (On-Off vs. Off-On). Treatment conditions (On vs. Off) lasted two weeks with immediate crossover. Tolerability, including study discontinuation and parent-report of mattress tolerance and ease of use, was tracked throughout the study. Efficacy assessments were obtained at baseline, prior to crossover, and end of study and included measures of autism traits, other psychopathology symptoms, sensory abnormalities, communication difficulties, quality of life, sleep diary parameters, and single-blinded actigraphy-derived sleep parameters. Statistical analyses evaluated differences in tolerability and efficacy when the STS system was on versus off. Results: STS system use was well tolerated (n = 2, 4.4% dropout) and resulted in parent-reported sleep quality improvements (STS off mean = 4.3, 95% CI = 4.05-4.54 vs. on mean = 4.9, 95%CI = 4.67-5.14). The technology was described by parents as very easy to use and child tolerance was rated as good. Parent-diary outcomes indicated improvements in falling asleep and reduced daytime challenging behavior. Actigraphy-derived sleep parameters indicated improved sleep duration and sleep efficiency. Improvements in child and family quality of life were identified on parent questionnaires. Conclusions: A future large sample phase 2 trial of the STS system is warranted and would benefit from extended study duration, an objective primary efficacy outcome, and careful attention to methodological issues that promote compliance with the intervention and study procedures.",2017,2022-08-24T07:19:33Z,2022-08-24T07:19:33Z,2017-01-01,95,NA,1,13,NA,Journal of clinical sleep medicine,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2510 N.

Previous observations suggested atypical patterns of heart rate changes in people with depression, often marked by elevated and unstable heart rate during sleep. This study assessed the validity of novel biomarkers based on heart rate changes across the sleep period to discriminate between individuals with depression and healthy controls. Methods: Retrospective data was collated in 993 adults: 545 with unipolar depressive syndromes referred to a specialized sleep clinic (74% females, mean±SD: 45 ± 16 years old), and 448 healthy controls (55% females, mean±SD: 40 ± 18 years old). Electrocardiography started before bedtime and extended beyond sleep offset. Sleep-based heart rate profiles were defined by a classification algorithm using a panel of temporal and frequency domain variables designed to distinguish between depression and control cases. A subset of 630 cases (315 depression & 315 controls) was randomly selected for training the machine-learning algorithm, and the remaining 259 cases (125 depression & 134 controls) were used for testing the algorithm. This process was repeated ten times with different subsets to assess classification stability. Results: After training, the algorithm classified individuals with depressive syndrome and healthy controls with a mean accuracy of 86%. More specifically, 82% of the depression cases were correctly identified by the algorithm (i.e. sensitivity) and, of the cases not classified as depression by the algorithm, 88% were from the control group (i.e. specificity). Conclusion: The algorithm's ability to distinguish between clinical groups based on heart rate changes across sleep is encouraging for the identification of objective biomarkers of depression. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular changes across sleep in the context of depression remain to be further investigated. Yet, the present results suggest that heart rate profiles during sleep may be useful as adjunctive assessment measures for depression.",2017,2022-08-24T07:19:33Z,2022-08-24T07:19:33Z,2017-01-01,A405,NA,NA,40,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: Associated Professional Sleep Societies,LLC",NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01375312,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To increase the airway space posterior to the tongue base without severely affecting the craniomandibular joint, the mHA was adjusted to anchor the mandible at 50% of maximum protrusion. MR producing an occlusal coverage but no protrusion served as a control appliance. All-night static charge-sensitive bed (SCSB) and finger oximeter recordings were done to six male patients in three conditions: first without dental device and then with mHA and with MR, in a random order, after a 2 month period of habituation. The oxyhaemoglobin desaturation events were 44.7 h-1 of recording observed during the control night, 29.6 h-1 with mHA (P = 0.087). The frequency of body movements decreased from 34.9 to 20.4 h-1 (P = 0.0079), respectively. MR had no significant effects either on the frequency of the desaturation events or the frequency of body movements, but the increased respiratory resistance breathing, indicating presence of partial upper airway obstruction, was reduced from 14.3 to 6.9% of the time in bed (P = 0.022). We conclude that 50% protrusion chosen for these experiments, produced with a mHA, brought about some alleviation of upper airway obstruction in our preselected patients, but did not lead to sufficient control of apnoea. The reduction of partial upper airway obstruction induced with a MR warrants further studies in a larger patient population.",1994,2022-08-24T07:19:33Z,2022-08-24T07:19:33Z,1994-01-01,595,NA,5,21,NA,Journal of oral rehabilitation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00108063,"*Sleep Apnea Syndromes/th [Therapy]; Adult; Airway Resistance; Cephalometry; Dental Occlusion; Humans; Male; Mandible; Middle Aged; Movement; Orthodontic Appliances, Functional; Polysomnography; Single-Blind Method; Sleep Apnea Syndromes/pp [Physiopathology]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There were eight premature infants with persistent bradycardias and 10 infants born full-term, admitted after an idiopathic apparent life-threatening event. No cause for the obstructive apneas was found. The infants were recorded with polygraphic techniques during two successive nights. They were randomly assigned to a rocking or a nonrocking mattress. The conditions were reversed the following night, in a crossover design., RESULTS: In both groups of infants, no significant difference was seen between the two consecutive nights for most of the variables studied: total sleep time, the proportion of non-rapid-eye-movement and rapid-eye-movement sleep, the number of arousals, the number and maximal duration of central apneas, the frequency of periodic breathing, the level of oxygen saturation, and heart rate. During the nonrocking nights, all infants had repeated obstructive breathing events. In seven of the eight preterm infants and in nine of the 10 full-term subjects, body rocking was associated with a significant decrease in the frequency of obstructive events.

DESIGN. A randomized study with 1-year follow-up., SETTING: A university hospital acting as a referral center for OSAS., PATIENTS: Symptomatic patients with OSAS (72 male and 4 female patients aged 18 to 65 years), who had oxygen desaturations in the overnight recording., INTERVENTIONS: After the initial diagnostic workup, patients were considered to be candidates for either N-CPAP (44 patients) or surgical treatment (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP] with or without mandibular osteotomy) (32 patients). Within the groups, the patients were then randomized to either the assigned treatment or conservative management., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of nocturnal oxygen desaturation events of 4% or more per hour in bed (ODI4); daytime somnolence; side effects., RESULTS: N-CPAP Group: Compliance with N-CPAP therapy at 1 year was 13 of 21. The most common reason for noncompliance was general intolerance of CPAP. All compliant patients had a normal ODI4 ( < 10), whereas 1 of 20 of their control subjects had a normal finding. Patients receiving active treatment were significantly less somnolent than their control subjects at 1 year (p < 0.05). SURGERY GROUP: At 1 year, 7 of 18 of the surgically treated and 1 of 14 of the conservatively treated patients had a normal ODI4 (p < 0.001). Daytime somnolence was significantly less severe in the surgically treated patients compared with their control subjects (p < 0.001) both at 3 and 12 months. The overall postoperative complication rate was 22%., CONCLUSIONS: N-CPAP is an effective therapy for OSAS, but compliance is a problem.

There are few data regarding effective treatment in this population. Five chronic hemodialysis patients completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study using a single bedtime dose of controlled release L-DOPA/carbidopa (100/25 mg) for treatment of RLS and sleep disruption. Leg movements per hour of sleep and percentage of sleep time accompanied by leg movements were decreased with treatment (101.0 +/- 29.1 events/hour on placebo vs. 61.0 +/- 28.3 events per hour on drug, p = 0.006; and 15.1 +/- 4.9% of sleep time with leg movements on placebo vs. 8.6 +/- 4.0% on drug, p = 0.014). In addition, arousals associated with leg movements (mean 209 +/- 49 events on placebo, mean 108 +/- 46 events on drug) and the leg movement arousal index (mean 59 +/- 23 events/hour on placebo, mean 23 +/- 9 events/hour on drug) were decreased by active medication (p = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively). Patients, however, continued to have very disrupted sleep and we could not document consistent subjective or objective improvement in overall sleep except for an increase in slow-wave sleep (SWS) from 9.0% to 22.8% (p = 0.01). The patterns of movements during sleep were not uniform in different patients, and the movements, although often periodic, were much longer than defined for PLMS. Because of this, finding suitable objective parameters to analyze was problematic. Measuring the percentage of sleep time during which there were leg movements was probably the most efficient and reproducible means of quantitating this disorder. Thus, although controlled-release L-DOPA/carbidopa at a dose of 100/25 mg given once nightly reduced leg movements and increased SWS, sleep continued to be disrupted.

All patients had secondary organ dysfunction., INTERVENTIONS: Administration of 100 mL boluses of 10% diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin, up to a maximum of 500 mL, given over 15 mins and separated by 60 to 90 mins., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hemodynamic parameters, norepinephrine and inotropic requirements, arterial and mixed venous blood gases, urine output, and biochemical and hematologic analyses were measured before diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin administration and at multiple time points up to 72 hrs. MAP was maintained at approximately preinfusion values and the reduction in norepinephrine requirements was used as the main end point to assess the efficacy of diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin as a vasopressor. Diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin demonstrated a marked vasopressor action, allowing norepinephrine requirements to be reduced from 0.29 +/- 0.15 (SD) microgram/kg/min to 0.15 +/- 0.14 and 0.07 +/- 0.10 microgram/kg/min after the first (at 1.5 hrs, p < .001) and last (at 7.5 hrs, p < .0001) boluses, respectively. These reductions in norepinephrine requirements were maintained at 24, 48, and 72 hrs (p < .01 at all time points). These hemodynamic changes began within 5 mins of starting the diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin infusion. MAP, heart rate, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), systemic vascular resistance index, and urine output did not demonstrate any significant changes from preinfusion values. Pulmonary vascular resistance index increased at 7.5 hrs despite nonsignificant increases in MPAP. Cardiac index and oxygen delivery index decreased significantly at 7.5 hrs and 24 hrs. Total plasma bilirubin increased significantly from baseline at 24 and 48 hrs, before returning to baseline values within 5 days. Platelet count was significantly reduced at 6 and 24 hrs. No other biochemical or hematologic analyses were altered significantly post diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin., CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study demonstrated that diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin is a potent vasopressor agent in critically ill patients with septicemic shock or systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

Part 2 consisted of a prospective concurrent collection of polysomnographic data., SETTING: Sleep Disorders Center in a university medical center., PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients who required standard clinical PSG as part of their clinical evaluation, regardless of suspected diagnosis, except patients requiring video recording for abnormal behaviors., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The DHSS is a digital recording system with miniature preamplifiers and the capacity to record 18 channels of polysomnographic data, including 4 channels of EEG (C3-A2, C4-A1, C3-O1 and C4-O2), right and left EOG, two channels of chin EMG, ECG naso-oral airflow, respiratory effort (piezo crystal thoracic and abdominal belts and bilateral interacostal EMG), snore microphone, bilateral anterior tibialis EMG, and body-position sensor. In part 1,77 DHSS home recordings were evaluated. No recordings were lost due to equipment failure and each parameter was scorable in greater than 95% of all epochs. Most of the subjective assessments by questionnaire following each study revealed no difference between the two testing situations. However, patients reported more sleep time and a better overall test experience in the lab. Assessments of sleep quality and morning alertness compared to usual were rated higher in the lab. After completing both studies, more patients preferred the lab study (p < .01), mostly because of minor inconveniences and apprehension regarding acquisition of data during the home study. There was no difference in the assessment of which test most accurately represented their sleep. In Part 2, the DHSS recorded concurrently with paper PSG in the laboratory in 16 patients. The results show no significant differences for any parameter and strong positive correlations for all parameters., CONCLUSION: Using the DHSS, unattended full PSG can be performed in the home with reliable and high quality recordings. Full PSG can be extended to a larger patient population, because it is no longer limited by the number of beds, and there is a reduction in cost due to elimination of overnight staff and facility cost.",1998,2022-08-24T07:19:35Z,2022-08-24T07:19:35Z,1998-01-01,635,NA,6,21,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00155860,"*Polysomnography/mt [Methods]; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Over Studies; Home Care Services; Humans; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Sleep Apnea Syndromes/di [Diagnosis]; Sleep, REM/ph [Physiology]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of this study was to improve sleep by reducing the frequency of nighttime noise and light changes., PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Two hundred sixty-seven incontinent nursing home residents in eight nursing homes., DESIGN: A randomized control group design with a delayed intervention for the control group., MEASUREMENTS: Bedside noise and light monitors recorded the number of 2-minute intervals at night with peak sounds recorded above 50 dBs and the number of light changes of at least 10 lux between adjacent 2-minute intervals. Daytime behavioral observations measured sleep and in-bed time during the day, and wrist activity was used to estimate sleep at night. Awakening events associated with the environmental variables were derived from the wrist activity data., INTERVENTION: A behavioral intervention implemented between 7:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. that involved feedback to nursing home staff about noise levels and implementation by research staff of procedures to both abate noise (e.g., turn off unwatched television sets) and to individualize nighttime incontinence care routines to be less disruptive to sleep., RESULTS: Noise was reduced significantly, from an average of 83 intervals per night with peak noises recorded above 50 dBs to an average of 58 intervals per night in the group that received the initial intervention, whereas noise in the control group showed no change (MANOVA group x time P < .001). All 10-dB categories of noise from 50 to 90+ dBs were reduced, and light changes were reduced from an average of four per night per resident to two per night (P < .001). Despite these significant changes in the environmental variables, there was a significant differential improvement in the intervention group on only two night sleep measures: awakening associated with a combination of noise plus light (P < .001) and awakening associated with light (P < .001). However, there was a significant correlation between change in noise and change in percent sleep from baseline to intervention (r = -.29, P < .05), suggesting that the intervention did not reduce noise to low enough levels to produce a significant improvement in sleep. The intervention effects on all environmental variables were replicated in the delayed intervention group, who again showed significant improvement on the same sleep measures. Observations of day sleep and in-bed time did not change over the phases of the trial for either group., CONCLUSION: The significant reductions in noise and light events resulting from the intervention did not lead to significant improvements in the day sleep and most night sleep measures. An intervention that combines both behavioral and environmental strategies and that addresses daytime behavioral factors associated with poor sleep (e.g., excessive time in bed) would potentially be more effective in improving the night sleep and quality of life of nursing home residents.",1999,2022-08-24T07:19:35Z,2022-08-24T07:19:35Z,1999-01-01,430,NA,4,47,NA,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00161902,"*Health Facility Environment/st [Standards]; *Home Nursing/st [Standards]; *Lighting/ae [Adverse Effects]; *Night Care/mt [Methods]; *Noise/ae [Adverse Effects]; *Noise/pc [Prevention & Control]; *Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/et [Etiology]; *Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/pc [Prevention & Control]; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Feedback; Humans; Inservice Training; Nursing Staff/ed [Education]; Nursing Staff/px [Psychology]; Polysomnography; Quality of Life; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/px [Psychology]; Time Factors; United States; Urinary Incontinence/nu [Nursing]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They were studied on 2 nights during the 3 hours after receiving a bedtime drink containing either a placebo or 100-proof vodka (1.5 ml/kg) in orange juice. We compared the results with those we reported previously in 10 nonsnoring but otherwise similar men. Waking R1 was the same in nonsnorers and snorers, and it was not affected by ethanol. During sleep on the control night, R1 increased by 70% in nonsnorers and by 280% in snorers. On the ethanol night, the increase from waking to sleeping was more than doubled in both nonsnorers and snorers. P0.1 and the responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia showed no differences between nonsnorers and snorers, therefore the results from the two groups were pooled. Minute ventilation and the hypercapnic response decreased from waking to sleeping and P0.1 was more negative during sleep, but there was no significant effect of ethanol. There was a significant correlation between the changes from waking to sleeping in R1 and P0.1 on the ethanol night suggesting that inspiratory effort increased in response to the increased resistance. The response to isocapnic hypoxia showed no effect of either sleep state or drink. Inspiratory time did not change but mean inspiratory flow (VT/T1) was significantly reduced during sleep on both control and ethanol nights. The duty cycle ratio (T1/Ttot) was significantly increased during sleep on the ethanol night. Despite its great effect on inspiratory resistance, especially in snorers, ethanol, in the dose used in our study, does not augment the depression of minute ventilation or of the hypercapnic response that occur normally in stage 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep. After ethanol, our subjects showed the decreased VT/T1 and the increased T1/Ttot that occur normally during sleep in response to an inspiratory resistive load. However, they also showed increased inspiratory effort.

Therefore, we studied airway-defensive behaviors and their relationship to spontaneous arousal behavior in 41 healthy sleeping infants (2-26 wk old), using two protocols: 1) infant was rebreathing expired air, face covered by bedding material; and 2) infant was exposed to hypercarbia, face uncovered. Multiple measurements of respiratory and motor activities were recorded (video, polygraph). The infants' response to increasing hypercarbia consisted of four highly stereotyped behaviors: sighs (augmented breaths), startles, thrashing limb movements, and full arousal (eyes open, cry). These behaviors occurred abruptly in self-limited clusters of activity and always in the same sequence: first a sigh coupled with a startle, then thrashing, then full arousal. Incomplete sequences (initial behaviors only) occurred far more frequently than the complete sequence and were variably effective in removing the bedding covering the airway. In both protocols, as inspired CO2 increased, incomplete arousal sequences recurred periodically and with increasing frequency and complexity until the infant either succeeded in clearing his/her airway or was completely aroused. Spontaneous arousal sequences, identical to those occurring during hypercarbia, occurred periodically during sleep. This observation suggests that the infant's airway-defensive responses to hypercarbia consist of an increase in the frequency and complexity of an endogenously regulated, periodically occurring sequence of arousal behaviors.",1997,2022-08-24T07:19:36Z,2022-08-24T07:19:36Z,1997-01-01,219,NA,1,83,NA,"Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. :",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00256787,"*Arousal/ph [Physiology]; *Asphyxia/pp [Physiopathology]; *Respiratory Mechanics/ph [Physiology]; *Sleep/ph [Physiology]; Behavior/ph [Physiology]; Female; Humans; Hypercapnia/pp [Physiopathology]; Hyperoxia/pp [Physiopathology]; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Male; Polysomnography; Reflex, Startle/ph [Physiology]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of the study was to compare the effects of a 4-day head-down bed rest (HDBR) (-6 degrees) and a 4-day confinement (C) on cardiovascular responses to orthostatic stress. Eight male subjects underwent head-up tilt (HUT) (+60 degrees) and lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) (-20, -30, -40 and -50 mmHg) before (D-1) and at the end (R1) of each situation. Blood pressure, heart rate variability (HRV) and spontaneous baroreflex slope (SBS) were determined. The HDBR reduced orthostatic tolerance, as five subjects presented orthostatic hypotension during the HUT at R1, compared with two subjects at D-1. These same two subjects presented orthostatic hypotension after confinement. The main findings, after HDBR, included reductions in RR interval and total spectral power and a decrease in the parasympathetic indicator (PNS) in favour of a decrease in vagal tone; the increase in the sympathetic indicator (SNS) was not significant. After confinement, the RR interval was also significantly reduced and PNS decreased, but not significantly. RR interval and PNS were further reduced during HUT and LBNP, reflecting a withdrawal of parasympathetic activity. SBS was reduced after HDBR (P < 0.05) and confinement (P = 0.05), with a further reduction during HUT and LBNP without difference between D-1 and R1. This experiment showed that a 4-day HDBR leads to impaired baroreflex function and changes in autonomic balance, which may contribute to orthostatic intolerance. Although less significant, similar patterns of changes in the autonomic nervous system were observed after confinement, suggesting an influence of the inactivity in cardiovascular deconditioning.",1997,2022-08-24T07:19:36Z,2022-08-24T07:19:36Z,1997-01-01,41,NA,1,17,NA,"Clinical physiology (Oxford, England)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00259544,*Posture/ph [Physiology]; Adult; Baroreflex/ph [Physiology]; Bed Rest; Fourier Analysis; Head-Down Tilt; Humans; Lower Body Negative Pressure; Male; Spectrum Analysis/mt [Methods],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The clinical utility of this procedure is limited, as the improvement usually subsides after the next night of sleep. In the present study, 40 depressed inpatients, being free of psychoactive medication for at least 7 days and who had responded to a TSD were then distributed (according to a matched-pair design) to a sleep phase advance (SPA = time in bed scheduled from 1700-2400 hrs) or a sleep phase delay (SPD = time in bed from 0200-0700 hrs) with a succeeding shift back (for one hour in the SPA group per day) respectively shift forward (for 30 minutes in the SPD group per day), until the initial sleep phase (2300-0600 hrs) was reached after seven days again. Based on previous observations it was hypothesized that a phase advance of the sleep period should prevent responders to TSD from relapsing. Whereas 75% of the TSD responders were stabilized by the phase advanced condition and did not relapse over a period of seven days, only 40% of the patients in the phase delayed condition did not relapse. Polysomnography during the course of the study gave no evidence that the unusual sleep schedules caused prolonged sleep deprivation. Abnormalities of REM sleep persisted both in the clinical responders and non-responders after the sleep wake manipulation.

Hypothermia is also a known predictor of dysrhythmias and myocardial ischemia in high-risk patients. We describe a prospective, randomized trial designed to test the hypothesis that forced-air warming (FAW) provides improved hemodynamic variables after coronary artery bypass graft. After institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 149 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft were randomized to receive postoperative warming with either FAW (n = 81) or a circulating water mattress (n = 68). Core temperature was measured at the tympanic membrane. A weighted mean skin temperature was calculated. Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance were monitored for 22 h postoperatively. Mean arterial blood pressure was maintained by protocol between 70 and 80 mm Hg by titration of nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside. The two groups had similar demographic characteristics. Tympanic and mean skin temperatures were similar between groups on intensive care unit admission. During postoperative rewarming, tympanic temperature was similar between groups, but mean skin temperature was significantly greater in the FAW group (P < 0.05). Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance were similar for the two groups. The percent of patients requiring nitroprusside to achieve the hemodynamic goals was less (P < 0.05) in the FAW group. In conclusion, aggressive cutaneous warming with FAW results in a higher mean skin temperature and a decreased requirement for vasodilator therapy in hypothermic patients after cardiac surgery. This most likely reflects attenuation of the adrenergic response or opening of cutaneous vascular beds as a result of surface warming.

The investigation was performed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Sixteen patients (4 male, 12 female) with previously established psychophysiological insomnia (ICSD-code 1.A.1.), and with a median age of 49 (range: 22 to 55), were included in the study. The main inclusion criteria were reported primary insomnia according to ICSD criteria, which was confirmed by polysomnographic recording, and the absence of acute diseases. During the study, the patients underwent 8 polysomnographic recordings: i.e., 2 recordings (baseline and study night) at each time point at which the short and long-term effects of placebo and valerian were tested. The target variable of the study was sleep efficiency. Other parameters describing objective sleep structure were the usual features of sleep-stage analysis, based on the rules of Rechtschaffen and Kales (1968), and the arousal index (scored according to ASDA criteria, 1992) as a sleep microstructure parameter. Subjective parameters such as sleep quality, morning feeling, daytime performance, subjectively perceived duration of sleep latency, and sleep period time were assessed by means of questionnaires. After a single dose of valerian, no effects on sleep structure and subjective sleep assessment were observed. After multiple-dose treatment, sleep efficiency showed a significant increase for both the placebo and the valerian condition in comparison with baseline polysomnography. We confirmed significant differences between valerian and placebo for parameters describing slow-wave sleep. In comparison with the placebo, slow-wave sleep latency was reduced after administration of valerian (21.3 vs. 13.5 min respectively, p<0.05). The SWS percentage of time in bed (TIB) was increased after long-term valerian treatment, in comparison to baseline (9.8 vs. 8.1% respectively, p<0.05). At the same time point, a tendency for shorter subjective sleep latency, as well as a higher correlation coefficient between subjective and objective sleep latencies, were observed under valerian treatment. Other improvements in sleep structure - such as an increase in REM percentage and a decrease in NREM1 percentage - took place simultaneously under placebo and valerian treatment. A remarkable finding of the study was the extremely low number of adverse events during the valerian treatment periods (3 vs. 18 in the placebo period). In conclusion, treatment with a herbal extract of radix valerianae demonstrated positive effects on sleep structure and sleep perception of insomnia patients, and can therefore be recommended for the treatment of patients with mild psychophysiological insomnia.",2000,2022-08-24T07:19:36Z,2022-08-24T07:19:36Z,2000-01-01,47,NA,2,33,NA,Pharmacopsychiatry,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00277111,"*Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Sleep Stages/de [Drug Effects]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; *Valerian/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Adult; Arousal/de [Drug Effects]; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phytotherapy; Plants, Medicinal; Polysomnography; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/px [Psychology]; Sleep, REM/de [Drug Effects]; Time Factors; Valerian/ae [Adverse Effects]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the target variable PLM/h of total sleep time (PLM/h TST), RLS patients showed an increased value of 40/h (normal 0-5/h). Further, we found an increased number of PLM (368), PLM/h of time in bed (49/h), PLM/h of REM sleep (11), PLM/h of non-REM sleep (46) and PLM/h awake (61). The arousal index was also increased (32/h; normal 0-25/h), as were arousals due to PLM. In the confirmatory part of our descriptive data analysis, ropinirole 0.5 mg significantly improved, as compared with placebo, the index PLM/h TST by 75%. In the descriptive part, all the other PLM variables were improved as well. Arousals due to PLM decreased, while spontaneous arousals increased. Respiratory variables, which had a priori been in the normal range, showed a slight but significant improvement after the dopamine agonist. Thus, 0.5 mg ropinirole significantly improved the target variable PLM/h TST, along with objective and subjective sleep quality and morning noopsychic performance, as described in the preceding paper.

Sleep variables were measured objectively by nocturnal polysomnography and subjectively by a postsleep questionnaire. Analysis of the data indicated that motion transferred laterally across a mattress was associated with a significant increase in Stage 1 sleep, and a significant decrease in Stage 3/4 sleep. Over-all, sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset did not show significant changes from control to experimental nights. The amount of change in sleep architecture, however, was more notable on the mattresses which transferred more motion. An implication of these findings is that motion transferred across the surface of a mattress, by lightening the depth of the sleep and thereby decreasing the auditory arousal threshold, can increase the potential for sleep disruption from environmental stimuli such as noise.",1999,2022-08-24T07:19:36Z,2022-08-24T07:19:36Z,1999-01-01,209,NA,1,89,NA,Perceptual and motor skills,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00310005,*Movement/ph [Physiology]; *Sleep/ph [Physiology]; Adult; Age Factors; Beds; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Humans; Male; Polysomnography/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data]; Wakefulness/ph [Physiology],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study was aimed at evaluating the effect on nocturnal erections of sildenafil versus a placebo taken at bedtime., METHODS: A double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study design was used to examine the effects of sildenafil and placebo on sleep-related erectile activity. Thirty selected patients with erectile dysfunction (vasculogenic etiology, 22 patients [73%]; psychogenic etiology, 8 patients [27%]) were submitted to a polysomnographic recording of nocturnal erections, using a RigiScan device during 3 consecutive nights. After a first night of adaptation, the 2 following nights were used to study patients after the administration of sildenafil (100 mg) or a placebo taken at bedtime., RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (77%) showed a significantly improved nocturnal erectile activity (according to the calculation of rigidity and tumescence activity units) after the administration of sildenafil (P <0.01), 5 patients (17%) showed comparable nocturnal erections with sildenafil and placebo, and 2 patients (6%) showed a significantly improved nocturnal erectile activity after taking the placebo (P <0.05). Overall, mean rigidity and tumescence activity values at the tip and base of the penis were significantly improved after sildenafil rather than placebo administration (P <0.001). The duration of tip rigidity greater than 60% was significantly longer during the night with sildenafil (P <0. 001). Although the number of erectile episodes was greater during the sildenafil night, this did not reach statistical significance., CONCLUSIONS: In most patients with good sleep efficiency and who have erectile dysfunction, sildenafil, rather than a placebo, taken at bedtime produces a significantly improved nocturnal erectile activity. Further studies are needed to verify whether this preliminary finding may constitute the basis for the use of sildenafil as a tool for preventing erectile dysfunction.",2000,2022-08-24T07:19:37Z,2022-08-24T07:19:37Z,2000-01-01,906,NA,6,56,NA,Urology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00325440,*Erectile Dysfunction/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Fluoxetine/pd [Pharmacology]; *Fluoxetine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Penile Erection/de [Drug Effects]; *Sleep/ph [Physiology]; Adult; Aged; Circadian Rhythm/de [Drug Effects]; Circadian Rhythm/ph [Physiology]; Drug Administration Schedule; Erectile Dysfunction/pc [Prevention & Control]; Fluoxetine/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Penile Erection/ph [Physiology]; Polysomnography/de [Drug Effects],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As a group, the measures indicated reasonably good adherence to treatment recommendations. Time spent in bed was significantly reduced at post-treatment, and the night to night consistency of time spent in bed and arising time was significantly greater at post-treatment. However, time spent in bed per night at post-treatment still exceeded therapist recommendations by a mean of 27.89 min (SD=31.72).

Each 9-day laboratory study began with a 3-day habituation period followed by a 24-hr study to obtain basal hormonal and sleep profiles (23:00-07:00). Subjects were then kept awake until 07:00 the next day and slept in darkness 07:00-15:00 for the next five 24-hr spans post-shift., SETTING: N/A., PARTICIPANTS: 6 normal, healthy men 24-31 years of age., INTERVENTIONS: Oral Triazolam (0.5 mg) or placebo given at 04:00 before the first shifted sleep/dark period (3 hours before bedtime) and at 07:00 (at bedtime) on days 2-5 post-shift., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep recordings and 24-hr cortisol and growth hormone profiles were obtained at baseline and on the first, third, and fifth days post-shift. Global measures of treatment efficacy were calculated for multiple endpoints representing circadian rhythmicity and sleep-wake homeostasis. With placebo, the shift induced disturbances of sleep and hormonal secretion, and a gradual re-entrainment of circadian rhythmicity. Triazolam significantly facilitated adaptation by accelerating re-entrainment of circadian rhythms (chronobiotic effect) and normalizing markers of sleep/wake homeostasis (hypnotic effect)., CONCLUSIONS: Appropriately timed administration of a benzodiazepine hypnotic appears to facilitate the adaptation of both circadian rhythmicity and sleep-wake homeostasis to a shifted dark/sleep cycle.

Conventional therapy with glucocorticosteroids does not inhibit the biosynthesis of leukotrienes. We therefore tested whether addition of the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast was of therapeutic benefit in a group of aspirin-intolerant patients with asthma of whom 90% already were treated with moderate to high doses of glucocorticosteroids. Under double-blind conditions, 80 aspirin-intolerant patients with asthma were randomized to receive 4 wk oral treatment of either 10 mg of montelukast or placebo once daily at bedtime. Pulmonary function was measured as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) once a week in the clinic and daily as morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Asthma symptoms and use of rescue bronchodilator were also recorded daily. Asthma specific quality of life (QoL) was assessed before and after the treatments. The group receiving montelukast showed a remarkable improvement of their asthma, whereas the group given placebo showed no change. Thus, from equal baseline values, the mean difference between the groups over the 4-wk treatment period was 10.2% for FEV(1) and 28.0 L for morning PEFR (p for both < 0.001). The improved pulmonary function in the group receiving montelukast occurred at the same time as 27% less bronchodilator was used (p < 0.05), and it was associated with fewer asthma symptoms than in the group given placebo, including 1.3 nights more of sleep per week and 54% fewer asthma exacerbations (p < 0.05).

Maternal labor analgesia was either intravenous fentanyl (n = 5) or paracervical bupivacaine blockade (n = 7). Neonatal recording from delivery to the age of 12 hours included continuous SCSB monitoring with ECG and oximeter for sleep states, respiration, oxygenation, heart rate, and body movements. In addition, umbilical blood pH, Apgar, Amiel-Tison's Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scoring (NACS), skin cyanosis scoring, blood pressure, rectal and skin temperatures, and skin blood flow measurements were performed., RESULTS: The study was interrupted, because one baby in the fentanyl group had a significant decrease in oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) to 59%. This was considcred to be residual effect of fentanyl and was treated with naloxone. SpO2 was generally lower in the fentanyl group. Epochs with SpO2 < 90% were more frequent in the fentanyl group, especially during active sleep (mean +/- SD 11.9 +/- 10.7% vs. 2.0 +/- 1.7% of epochs, p = 0.034). Mean heart rate values were lower in the fentanyl group (121.1 +/- 6.4 vs. 132.6 +/- 6.8 beats per minute, p = 0.02), and this difference was seen during wake and all sleep states. Maximum heart rate values were lower in the fentanyl group, too. The opiate group had less quiet sleep than controls (9.6 +/- 2.8% vs. 18.3 +/- 8.3%, p = 0.05). NACS after birth was lower in the fentanyl group (median [range] 15 [13-26] vs. 22 [20-25], p = 0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: Several differences were seen between the fentanyl and the control group babies. The SCSB method proved sensitive enough to find neonatal effects of maternal analgesia. Together with ECG and SpO2 monitoring, SCSB gives plentiful information on neonatal well-being in a non-invasive way. Results of this study emphasize the importance of neonatal monitoring after maternal opiate use in labor.",2000,2022-08-24T07:19:38Z,2022-08-24T07:19:38Z,2000-01-01,597,NA,8,16,NA,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00399986,"*Analgesia, Obstetrical/ae [Adverse Effects]; *Analgesics, Opioid/ae [Adverse Effects]; *Fentanyl/ae [Adverse Effects]; *Infant, Newborn/ph [Physiology]; Adult; Anesthetics, Local; Apgar Score; Bupivacaine; Cardiotocography; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic/is [Instrumentation]; Movement; Nerve Block; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Respiration; Sleep",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There were 357 men and women enrolled in the trial with an untreated sitting diastolic BP of 95 to 114 mm Hg and ambulatory daytime diastolic BP > or =85 mm Hg. Patients were randomized to either COER-verapamil hydrochloride each evening (240 mg titrated to 360 mg), enalapril each morning (10 mg titrated to 20 mg), losartan each morning (50 mg titrated to 100 mg), or placebo. Early morning assessments of BP, heart rate, and the heart rate systolic BP product were performed by use of 24-hour ambulatory recordings after 4 weeks (low dose) and 8 weeks (high dose) of therapy., RESULTS: Results were similar at weeks 4 and 8 for all treatment groups except that the magnitude of change was greater at week 8. After 8 weeks of treatment, reductions in early morning BP by COER-verapamil were significantly greater (-15/-10 mm Hg) than enalapril (-9/-7 mm Hg, P <.01) and losartan (-8/-5 mm Hg, P <.001). COER-verapamil also led to greater reductions in morning heart rate, the rate-pressure product, and the rate-of-rise of BP compared with the other 2 active treatment groups. Reductions in mean 24-hour BP were greater in patients treated with COER-verapamil compared with placebo and losartan, and similar to reductions in patients treated with enalapril., CONCLUSIONS: Bedtime administration of an agent designed to parallel the circadian rhythm of BP and heart rate led to significantly greater early morning hemodynamic effects compared with other conventional once-daily antihypertensive agents dosed in the morning.",2002,2022-08-24T07:19:38Z,2022-08-24T07:19:38Z,2002-01-01,657,NA,4,144,NA,American heart journal,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00410308,"*Antihypertensive Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]; *Enalapril/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Heart Rate/de [Drug Effects]; *Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Losartan/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Verapamil/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Blood Pressure/ph [Physiology]; Circadian Rhythm; Delayed-Action Preparations; Double-Blind Method; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; Female; Heart Rate/ph [Physiology]; Humans; Hypertension/pp [Physiopathology]; Male; Statistics, Nonparametric; Systole/de [Drug Effects]; Systole/ph [Physiology]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This pilot study investigates the effects of aspirin on blood pressure in untreated hypertensive patients who received aspirin at different times of the day according to their rest-activity cycle. We studied 100 untreated patients with mild hypertension (34 men and 66 women), 42.5+/-11.6 (mean+/-SD) years of age, randomly divided into 3 groups: nonpharmacological hygienic-dietary recommendations; the same recommendations and aspirin (100 mg/d) on awakening; or the same recommendations and aspirin before bedtime. Blood pressure was measured every 20 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes at night for 48 consecutive hours before and after 3 months of intervention. The circadian pattern of blood pressure in each group was established by population multiple-component analysis. After 3 months of nonpharmacological intervention, there was a small, nonsignificant reduction of blood pressure (<1.1 mm Hg; P>0.341). There was no change in blood pressure when aspirin was given on awakening (P=0.229). A highly significant blood pressure reduction was, however, observed in the patients who received aspirin before bedtime (decrease of 6 and 4 mm Hg in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively; P<0.001). Results indicate a statistically significant administration time-dependent effect of low-dose aspirin on blood pressure in untreated patients with mild hypertension.

Regular times for nocturnal sleep reduced perceived symptom severity, but did not reduce the amount of unscheduled daytime sleep. Only the combination of scheduled naps and regular nocturnal sleep times, significantly reduced both symptom severity and the amount of unscheduled daytime sleep in treated narcoleptic subjects.

Vascular effects may depend on the type of vessel and we, therefore, investigated both smaller arteries, i.e. resistance arteries and small arterioles, and large conduit arteries. Vascular function was measured by acetylcholine- and sodium-nitroprusside-mediated vasodilation, and capillary recruitment, in the skin microcirculation; by forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to several agonists and to N-G-monomethyl L-arginine (L-NMMA) in the forearm vascular bed; by flow-mediated vasodilation in the brachial artery; and by determination of soluble levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and E-selectin. Twenty-eight individuals received dobesilate and 24 placebo. No effect of calcium dobesilate on endothelial function, blood pressure or markers of oxidation was observed compared with placebo. The difference in acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation in the microcirculation was -52.1%-point (95% confidence interval -132.8 to 28.1); in sodium-nitroprusside-mediated vasodilation in the microcirculation, 2.6%-point (-95.1 to 100.2); in capillary recruitment, 2.5%-point (-6.8 to 11.7); in acetylcholine-induced increases in FBF (n=28), 23%-point (-173 to 126); in L-NMMA-induced reduction of basal FBF, -2.8%-point (-29.3 to 23.8); in flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery, 0.3%-points (-2.7 to 3.3); in 24-h systolic blood pressure, 2.1 mmHg (-1.3 to 5.5); in soluble VCAM-1, 54 ng/ml (-8 to 115); in soluble ICAM-1, 9 ng/ml (-49 to 67); in sE-selectin, -17 ng/ml (-44 to 11); in ketocholesterol 5 nM (-17 to 26); and in oxidised LDL -1.6 U/l (-6.7 to 3.5).

Recently, the biological clock was shown to be involved in autonomic cardiovascular regulation. Our objective was to determine whether enhancement of the functioning of the biological clock by repeated nighttime melatonin intake might reduce ambulatory blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in 16 men with untreated essential hypertension to investigate the influence of acute (single) and repeated (daily for 3 weeks) oral melatonin (2.5 mg) intake 1 hour before sleep on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and actigraphic estimates of sleep quality. Repeated melatonin intake reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure during sleep by 6 and 4 mm Hg, respectively. The treatment did not affect heart rate. The day-night amplitudes of the rhythms in systolic and diastolic blood pressures were increased by 15% and 25%, respectively. A single dose of melatonin had no effect on blood pressure. Repeated (but not acute) melatonin also improved sleep. Improvements in blood pressure and sleep were statistically unrelated. In patients with essential hypertension, repeated bedtime melatonin intake significantly reduced nocturnal blood pressure. Future studies in larger patient group should be performed to define the characteristics of the patients who would benefit most from melatonin intake. The present study suggests that support of circadian pacemaker function may provide a new strategy in the treatment of essential hypertension.",2004,2022-08-24T07:19:39Z,2022-08-24T07:19:39Z,2004-01-01,192,NA,2,43,NA,"Hypertension (dallas, tex. :",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00471945,"*Antihypertensive Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Melatonin/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]; Circadian Rhythm; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Humans; Male; Melatonin/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Middle Aged; Sleep; Wakefulness",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Close monitoring of the coagulation is therefore crucial. In this study, we assess a novel bedside instrument based on free oscillating rheometry, measuring the degree of coagulation activity as clotting onset time, COT. COT measurements are conducted in whole blood, and thus reflect the overall hemostasis., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine healthy volunteers were subjected to intravenous injection of 2 ng/kg endotoxin. To quantify the activation of the coagulation system, COT was assessed along with prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)., RESULTS: Baseline COT was 10.6 +/- 3.6 min. Three hours after endotoxin injection, maximal body temperature and heart rate were registered. At this time, an activation of the coagulation was observed as a significant decrease in COT to 8.0 +/- 1.0 min, a decrease in aPTT and increased levels of F1 + 2. COT levels, body temperature and heart rate subsequently normalized towards initial levels. F1 + 2 however continued to increase throughout the study., CONCLUSIONS: COT is a rapid test, performed in less than 15 min. COT was superior to F1+ 2 in monitoring the endotoxin-induced activation of the coagulation, since COT covariated with clinical symptoms, whereas F1 + 2 did not. This is, to our knowledge, the first time an overall coagulation monitoring method has been assessed bedside to detect endotoxin-induced activation of the coagulation. The COT test shows promising results, but further studies are needed to reveal its potential in the intensive care monitoring arsenal.",2003,2022-08-24T07:19:39Z,2022-08-24T07:19:39Z,2003-01-01,329,NA,6,111,NA,Thrombosis research,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00488918,"*Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/bl [Blood]; *Endotoxins/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Monitoring, Physiologic/mt [Methods]; Adult; Blood Coagulation Tests; Escherichia coli; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Humans; Male; Partial Thromboplastin Time; Peptide Fragments/me [Metabolism]; Prothrombin Time; Prothrombin/me [Metabolism]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study investigated the polysomnographic sleep structure and subjective sleep quality of 14 healthy male subjects given placebo, quetiapine 25 mg or quetiapine 100 mg. Volunteers were studied 3 times for 3 consecutive nights (N0, adaptation; N1, standard sleep conditions; N2, acoustic stress) 4 days apart. Treatment was administered orally 1 h before bedtime on nights 1 and 2. Quetiapine 25 mg and 100 mg significantly improved sleep induction and continuity under standard and acoustic stress conditions. Increases in total sleep time, sleep efficiency, percentage sleep stage 2 and subjective sleep quality were seen. A significant increase in periodic leg movements during sleep was observed with quetiapine 100 mg. The sleep-improving properties of quetiapine may be important in counteracting different aspects of psychopathology in schizophrenia and other disorders.

The present study was undertaken to assess whether modafinil could be used to reduce daytime fatigue, sleepiness, or both in patients with primary insomnia and whether the pharmacologic augmentation of wakefulness might produce improved sleep by itself or in combination with CBT., METHODS: 30 subjects with primary insomnia were enrolled in this study and were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment conditions: (1) placebo plus CBT, (2) 100 mg modafinil plus CBT, or (3) 100 mg modafinil plus a contact control (monitor-only condition). Subjects were continuously monitored with sleep diaries from study intake until study end (10 weeks) and were evaluated on a weekly basis for changes in sleepiness., RESULTS: The mean age of the group was 41.3 years (SD, 13.4), and 70.4% of subjects were women. All 3 groups exhibited mean sleep latency and wake after sleep-onset times that were more than 30 minutes in duration. The mean pretreatment sleep profiles did not significantly differ. Modafinil, when administered alone, did not significantly affect the patients' sleep profiles. A trend, however, was evident for improved sleep latency. Modafinil, as an adjunct to CBT, tended to (1) reduce daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and (2) enhance compliance with CBT. With respect to the latter, subjects in the modafinil plus CBT group more reliably adhered to the prescribed phase delay in bedtime than did the placebo plus CBT group., DISCUSSION: These data suggest that modafinil may be used to diminish the negative side effects of CBT (increased daytime sleepiness) and may increase subject compliance with therapy. Whether enhanced daytime function mediates the change in adherence and whether reduced sleepiness and enhanced compliance translate to less patient attrition in the clinical setting remain to be evaluated.",2004,2022-08-24T07:19:39Z,2022-08-24T07:19:39Z,2004-01-01,715,NA,4,27,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00490462,*Benzhydryl Compounds/pd [Pharmacology]; *Benzhydryl Compounds/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Cognition/de [Drug Effects]; *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/mt [Methods]; *Neuroprotective Agents/pd [Pharmacology]; *Neuroprotective Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/th [Therapy]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Modafinil; Polysomnography; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/di [Diagnosis]; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/dt [Drug Therapy]; Surveys and Questionnaires,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We hypothesized that altered heart rate variability is present in TS in comparison with controls, and can be influenced by hormonal replacement therapy (HRT)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined the impact of HRT on sympathovagal control of heart rate variability. Patients (n = 8, aged 29.5 +/- 5.3 years; no treatment or HRT) and controls (n = 8, aged 28.5 +/- 4.2 years; no treatment) were examined by short-term spectral analysis (supine-standing), bedside neuropathy tests, and 24-h ambulatory BP. N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), renin, aldosterone and urinary albumin excretion was determined. The interaction between position and status (TS or control) was examined for data from spectral analysis., RESULTS: Low-frequency (LF) power, coefficient of component variation of LF (both measures of sympathetic and vagal activity), and the LF: high-frequency (HF) power ratio (a measure of sympathovagal balance) were diminished in TS compared with controls, especially during standing. Systolic and diastolic night ambulatory BP (both P = 0.03), and systolic and diastolic night: day ratio (P = 0.01; P = 0.004) was increased in TS. During HRT diastolic day (P = 0.05) and 24-h diastolic ambulatory BP (P = 0.08) decreased. N-terminal pro-BNP was elevated in TS., CONCLUSION: Decreased sympathovagal balance or tone and nocturnal hypertension is present in TS, and N-terminal pro-BNP is elevated. HRT did not modulate the sympathovagal tone, but decreased BP.

This study examined peppermint's effects on polysomnographic (PSG) sleep, alertness, and mood when presented before bedtime. Twenty-one healthy sleepers (mean age +/- S.D., 20.1 +/- 2.0 years) completed three consecutive laboratory sessions (adaptation, control, and stimulus nights). Peppermint reduced fatigue and improved mood and was rated as more pleasant, intense, stimulating, and elating than water. These perceptual qualities associated with sleep measures: subjects rating peppermint as very intense had more total sleep than those rating it as moderately intense, and also showed more slow-wave sleep (SWS) in the peppermint than control session. Furthermore, subjects who found peppermint stimulating showed more NREM and less REM sleep while those rating it as sedating took longer to reach SWS. Peppermint did not affect PSG sleep, however, when these perceptual qualities were not considered. Peppermint also produced gender-differentiated responses: it increased NREM sleep in women, but not men, and alertness in men, but not women, compared with the control.

By offering access to bed-chair pressure sensors in hospitalized patients with perceived fall risk, nurses may be less inclined to resort to physical restraints, thereby improving clinical outcomes., AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the access of bed-chair pressure sensors reduces physical restraint use in geriatric rehabilitation wards., DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial., METHODS: Consecutively, patients admitted to two geriatric wards specialized in stroke rehabilitation in a convalescent hospital in Hong Kong, and who were perceived by nurses to be at risk of falls were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. For the intervention group subjects, nurses were given access to bed-chair pressure sensors. These sensors were not available to control group subjects, as in usual practice. The trial continued until discharge. The primary outcomes were the proportion of subjects restrained by trunk restraint, bedrails or chair-board and the proportion of trial days in which each type of physical restraint was applied. The secondary outcomes were the proportions of those who improved in the mobility and transfer domains of modified Barthel index on discharge and of those who fell., RESULTS: One hundred and eighty subjects were randomized.

This is the first polysomnographic study testing the impact of 2 doses of alcohol ingestion (thus reflecting ""normal"" social drinking and alcohol abuse) in a single-blind randomized design in healthy volunteers. The study evaluated a short-term acute drinking period for 3 and 2 days of withdrawal from alcohol not only for polysomnographic variables but also for subjective estimates of sleep quality., METHODS: In a crossover design with a 1-week interval, healthy subjects received alcohol to raise their blood alcohol to either 0.03 or 0.1% BAL at bedtime for 3 consecutive nights after an alcohol-free baseline night. Objective (polysomnography) and subjective sleep (questionnaires) was recorded each night. During the following 2 days, alcohol was discontinued with simultaneous measurements of sleep to gauge withdrawal effects., RESULTS: At a dose of alcohol leading to BAL of 0.03%, no clear effects could be detected. Following an evening BAL of 0.1%, a hypnotic-like effect (shortened sleep latency, reduced number of wake periods, decreased stage 1 sleep) occurred primarily during the first half of the night with signs of rebound effects being already present during the second half of the night (increased stage 1 sleep). At this dose, alcohol significantly increased slow-wave sleep (SWS) in the first half of the night and reduced REM density in the beginning of the night. After discontinuation of the higher alcohol dose, REM sleep amount increased. No significant withdrawal or rebound effects could be observed for parameters of sleep continuity during the 2 nights after discontinuation from alcohol at a BAL of 0.1%., CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the small sample size, the results of this study need to be interpreted with caution. Short-term moderate alcohol consumption (BAL 0.03%) did not significantly alter objective or subjective parameters of sleep. Higher doses of alcohol resulting in a BAL level of 0.10% immediately before going to bed mainly influenced sleep in the first half of the night, resembling the effects of a short-acting hypnotic drug, including a suppression of phasic aspects of REM sleep (REM density). Interestingly, analysis of the latter part of these nights indicated the immediate presence of withdrawal effects (increased light sleep). No statistically significant effects on sleep parameters were observable during the 2 nights of withdrawal from alcohol at the higher BAL. Interpreted carefully, our data indicate that negative effects on sleep occur already with short-term use of alcohol at doses of BAL of 0.10%, despite hypnotic-like effects during the first hours of sleep, especially during the latter part of the night.",2006,2022-08-24T07:19:40Z,2022-08-24T07:19:40Z,2006-01-01,1527,NA,9,30,NA,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00567571,"*Central Nervous System Depressants/pd [Pharmacology]; *Ethanol/pd [Pharmacology]; *Polysomnography/de [Drug Effects]; Adult; Central Nervous System Depressants/bl [Blood]; Ethanol/bl [Blood]; Female; Humans; Liver Function Tests; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Sleep, REM/de [Drug Effects]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The exact trigger for these thermoregulatory changes around sleep onset, however, is unknown. Our aim was to examine one possible trigger: prior knowledge of bedtime. Fourteen young, healthy male subjects (mean age+/-sem: 21.9+/-0.6 years), participated in a randomized, single-blind crossover study, where knowledge of bedtime was manipulated. Following a baseline night, subjects completed three experimental nights: (A) aware of bedtime; (B) no knowledge of bedtime; (C) misinformed about bedtime. In all conditions lights were turned off at each subject's habitual bedtime (determined from sleep diaries), to individually standardize the time of lights off. Polysomnography, rectal and peripheral (foot) temperatures were recorded continuously on each night. There was no significant difference in the time of sleep onset among conditions (mean+/-s.d.: 11:55 h+/-0.73 min), and in all conditions sleep onset occurred at the same rectal temperature. A significant difference in the temperature gradient between rectal and peripheral temperatures among the conditions was evident from 90 min to 40 min prior to sleep onset (P=0.05), with subjects achieving a more rapid rate of temperature change in the B and C condition relative to condition A. The present findings suggest that knowledge of bedtime may modulate changes in temperature around the time of sleep onset. It appears that there is an optimal core body temperature at which to initiate sleep, and changes in the rate of peripheral heat loss may assist in achieving this optimal temperature, and hence facilitate sleep onset.",2007,2022-08-24T07:19:40Z,2022-08-24T07:19:40Z,2007-01-01,643,NA,4,90,NA,Physiology & behavior,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00577493,*Body Temperature Regulation/ph [Physiology]; *Body Temperature/ph [Physiology]; *Reaction Time/ph [Physiology]; *Sleep/ph [Physiology]; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Cross-Over Studies; Humans; Male; Polysomnography/mt [Methods]; Single-Blind Method,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Significant increase in total sleep time, sleep efficiency, slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with decreases in wake time were observed after olanzapine. Decreases in wake time, REM sleep and stage shifts together with increases in stage 2 were obtained after risperidone. Haloperidol showed only a tendency to increase sleep efficiency and stage 2 and to decrease wake time. Olanzapine showed decreases in power density in frequencies higher than 10 Hz during all sleep stages and in frequencies lower than 5 Hz range in SWS; decreases in the dynamics of spindle frequency activity (SFA) in the second and fourth non-rapid eye movement (NREM) episodes were also obtained. Risperidone presented increases in the 3.6-10.8 Hz frequency range in NREM sleep stages and in stage 2. Haloperidol also showed increases in NREM sleep stages and in stage 2, but these were in frequencies higher than 10 Hz, with increases in the dynamics of SFA in the first NREM episode.

After a 3-night polysomnographic (PSG) screen, treatment was administered 30 min before bedtime on 2 consecutive nights during 3 separate sessions including PSG. Efficacy analyses (n = 23) were based on the average of Nights 1 and 2, and compared gaboxadol versus placebo. Baseline was the average of Nights 2 and 3 of the screening session. Both gaboxadol doses significantly (P < 0.05) improved mean total sleep time (mean +/- SD: baseline = 368.0 +/- 51.1 min, 15 mg = 420.3 +/- 24.5 min, 5 mg = 419.8 +/- 20.4 min, placebo = 408.7 +/- 30.4 min). Both gaboxadol doses reduced mean wake after sleep onset, although statistical significance was only achieved with 5 mg (baseline = 61.6 +/- 35.4 min, 15 mg = 38.0 +/- 21.1 min, 5 mg = 34.6 +/- 14.3 min, placebo = 43.4 +/- 22.9 min). Gaboxadol 15 mg also significantly reduced mean latency to persistent sleep (baseline = 55.6 +/- 27.0 min, 15 mg = 23.6 +/- 15.1 min, placebo = 30.0 +/- 19.1 min) and enhanced slow wave duration (baseline = 72.4 +/- 20.8 min, 15 mg = 114.0 +/- 37.5 min, placebo = 93.9 +/- 31.3 min) with no significant effects on REM sleep duration.

Repeated measurements during placebo and methylphenidate treatment were conducted for the ADHD group. Actigraphic sleep estimates showed that ADHD subjects took longer to fall asleep, had lower sleep efficiency, and had shorter within-night periods of uninterrupted sleep. These findings were consistent with subjective complaints. Actigraphic measures of ADHD subjects showed continuously elevated daytime activity levels, resulting in a 24-hour pattern that was more stable and less variable than in controls. Methylphenidate led to a later bedtime, later sleep onset, and reduction in sleep duration. However, number and total duration of nocturnal awakenings decreased, while mean duration of within-night periods of uninterrupted sleep increased, indicating more consolidated sleep., CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that sleep problems are inherent in adults with ADHD and that methylphenidate reduced total sleep time but improved sleep quality by consolidating sleep.",2007,2022-08-24T07:19:41Z,2022-08-24T07:19:41Z,2007-01-01,433,NA,4,30,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00589138,*Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/di [Diagnosis]; *Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Central Nervous System Stimulants/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Methylphenidate/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Sleep Wake Disorders/di [Diagnosis]; *Sleep Wake Disorders/dt [Drug Therapy]; Adult; Central Nervous System Stimulants/ae [Adverse Effects]; Circadian Rhythm; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Methylphenidate/ae [Adverse Effects]; Middle Aged; Motor Activity/de [Drug Effects]; Polysomnography; Sleep Deprivation/ci [Chemically Induced]; Sleep Deprivation/di [Diagnosis]; Sleep Wake Disorders/ci [Chemically Induced]; Wakefulness/de [Drug Effects],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recently, Kario, et al proposed the usefulness of ME difference (morning minus evening systolic BP) and ME average (average of morning and evening systolic BP) for the evaluation of antihypertensive treatment. Cilnidipine is a novel calcium channel blocker (CCB) that exerts inhibitory actions not only on L-type but also on N-type calcium channels. We investigated the effect of bedtime administration of cilnidipine (10 mg) in addition to the antihypertensive treatment for uncontrolled morning hypertension. Twenty-three hypertensive outpatients (13 males and 10 females; mean age, 66.9 years) with stable antihypertensive medication and uncontrolled morning BP were studied using self-measured BP monitoring in the morning and evening. Morning SBP (P < 0.001) and DBP (P < 0.001) decreased significantly from 150.2 +/- 8.7 and 87.8 +/- 9.3 to 132.7 +/- 7.4 and 77.5 +/- 8.5 mmHg, respectively, after the addition of cilnidipine. Morning heart rate did not change (63.3 +/- 7.0 to 64.1 +/- 9.4). The evening SBP, but not DBP, decreased significantly after treatment. Both the ME average (P < 0.001) and ME difference (P < 0.01) significantly decreased from 143.0 +/- 9.2 and 14.3 +/- 12.4 to 131.3 +/- 7.2 and 2.8 +/- 9.2 mmHg after treatment, respectively. The microalbuminuria decreased from 39.6 +/- 13.2 to 27.3 +/- 8.4 mg/g Cr.

However, due to the short duration of action of conventional levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor formulations, multiple dosing may be required in individual patients with persisting symptoms. We assessed whether a new levodopa formulation containing levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone (LCE) improves levodopa action in RLS., METHODS: Twenty-eight RLS patients with periodic limb movement (PLM) received single doses of Stalevo 50 (LCE50; 50/12.5/200 mg), Stalevo 100 (LCE100; 100/25/200 mg), Stalevo 150 (LCE150; 150/37.5/200 mg), Sinemet 100 (LC100; 100/25 mg), or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study with polysomnography. Periodic limb movements per hour (PLM/h) during total sleep time and PLM during total time in bed were the primary and secondary variables, respectively., RESULTS: Mean PLM/h during total sleep time after Stalevo 50 (12.6/h, P < 0.05), LCE100, LCE150, and LC100 (6.4/h, 3.5/h and 9.5/h, respectively; P < 0.01) were significantly reduced compared with placebo (25.7/h). Improvement was also observed in PLM/h during total time in bed for all treatments (P < 0.01) and a significant dose response observed between LCE doses (P < 0.05). Compared with LC100, LCE100 and LCE150 reduced PLMs during the second half (P = 0.06 and P < 0.001, respectively) or during the last 3 early morning hours (hours 5-7 from the start of recording) of the night (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). All formulations were well tolerated., CONCLUSIONS: Single doses of LCE tablets decreased PLMs in a dose-related manner in RLS patients. Prolonged effects of levodopa on PLMs suggest that, compared with standard levodopa, this new levodopa formulation provides longer symptom control throughout the night in patients with previously untreated RLS.",2007,2022-08-24T07:19:41Z,2022-08-24T07:19:41Z,2007-01-01,335,NA,6,30,NA,Clinical neuropharmacology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00621867,"*Carbidopa/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Catechols/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Enzyme Inhibitors/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Nitriles/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Restless Legs Syndrome/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Restless Legs Syndrome/pp [Physiopathology]; Cross-Over Studies; Delayed-Action Preparations; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Drug Combinations; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Levodopa/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Movement/de [Drug Effects]; Polysomnography/mt [Methods]; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), repeated arousals were induced: 1) by increasing inspired CO(2) and 2) by stepwise decreases in CPAP level. Respiratory effort was measured with an oesophageal balloon. End-tidal CO(2 )tension (P(ET,CO(2))) was monitored with a nasal catheter.

For each sleep parameter, total variance was determined for between-subject variance and within-subject variance from day-to-day. Sleep concordance was examined using multinomial logistic regression to compare trichotomous patient-caregiver combinations of good and bad sleepers. For both patients and caregivers, between-subject daily variability accounted for more of the variance in sleep than within-subject variability. Patient depression and caregiver management style were significant predictors both for concordant poor sleep (both patient and caregiver with sleep efficiency < or =85%) and patient-caregiver sleep discordance., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides data that sleep disturbances for persons with AD and their family caregivers vary considerably night to night, and that poor sleep in one member of the caregiving dyad is not necessarily linked to disturbed sleep in the other. Understanding the complex interrelationship of sleep in AD patients and caregivers is an important first step towards the development of individualized and effective treatment strategies.",2008,2022-08-24T07:19:41Z,2022-08-24T07:19:41Z,2008-01-01,741,NA,5,31,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00640030,"*Alzheimer Disease/px [Psychology]; *Caregivers/px [Psychology]; *Sleep Deprivation/px [Psychology]; Activities of Daily Living/px [Psychology]; Adult; Affect; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Behavior Therapy; Caregivers/ed [Education]; Circadian Rhythm; Depression/px [Psychology]; Female; Health Education; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phototherapy; Polysomnography; Sleep Deprivation/th [Therapy]; Social Support; Statistics as Topic; Wakefulness",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Polysomnographic assessment and radiographs for assessment of adenoid size were performed after completion of each phase., RESULTS: There were significant improvements in both polysomnographic measures (sleep latency, slow-wave sleep, and rapid-eye-movement sleep), in the magnitude of respiratory disturbance (apnea/hypopnea index, nadir pulse oxygen saturation), and in adenoid size among the 48 children who completed the treatment phase compared with 32 children who received placebo in their initial arm, with normalization of sleep measures in 54.1% of the treated children. Furthermore, discontinuation of treatment for 8 weeks for 25 children revealed a sustained duration of the initial treatment effect., CONCLUSIONS: A 6-week treatment with intranasal budesonide effectively reduced the severity of mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the magnitude of the underlying adenoidal hypertrophy, and this effect persisted for at least 8 weeks after cessation of therapy.

This trial investigated the administration-time dependent antihypertensive efficacy of the slow-release, once-a-day nifedipine gastrointestinal-therapeutic-system (GITS) formulation., METHODS: We studied 180 untreated hypertensives (86 men and 94 women), 52.5 +/- 10.7 years of age, randomly assigned to receive nifedipine (30 mg/day) as a monotherapy either upon awakening or at bedtime. BP was measured for 48 h before and after 8 weeks of treatment., RESULTS: The BP reduction after treatment was significantly larger with bedtime dosing mainly during night time sleep (P < 0.012). The number of patients with controlled ambulatory BP after treatment was greater with bedtime than morning treatment (P = 0.016). The baseline prevalence of nondipping was unaltered after ingestion of nifedipine on awakening, but reduced from 51 to 35% after bedtime dosing (P = 0.025). The morning surge of BP, a risk factor for stroke, was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) only after bedtime administration of nifedipine. Bedtime in comparison to awakening-time ingestion of nifedipine was also associated with a reduction in the incidence of edema from 13 to 1% (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The increased efficacy on ambulatory BP as well as the significantly reduced prevalence of edema after bedtime as compared to morning ingestion of nifedipine should be taken into account when prescribing this medication to patients with essential hypertension.",2008,2022-08-24T07:19:41Z,2022-08-24T07:19:41Z,2008-01-01,948,NA,8,21,NA,American journal of hypertension,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00665966,"*Calcium Channel Blockers/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Nifedipine/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Adult; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]; Calcium Channel Blockers/ae [Adverse Effects]; Circadian Rhythm; Delayed-Action Preparations/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Delayed-Action Preparations/ae [Adverse Effects]; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Edema/ci [Chemically Induced]; Edema/ep [Epidemiology]; Edema/pc [Prevention & Control]; Female; Humans; Hypertension/ep [Epidemiology]; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Nifedipine/ae [Adverse Effects]; Risk Factors; Risk Reduction Behavior; Stroke/ep [Epidemiology]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Slow wave sleep (SWS) was a secondary endpoint. Analyses were based on the change from baseline for the average of nights 1/2, and nights 29/30, and compared gaboxadol versus placebo. Exploratory endpoints included patient's subjective assessment of total sleep time (sTST), WASO (sWASO), time to sleep onset (sTSO), and number of awakenings (sNAW); these analyses were based on weekly means. 1) Adult study. GBX15 significantly (P < or = 0.05) improved WASO through nights 29/30 but had no significant effects on LPS. No significant differences were seen for GBX10 versus placebo on WASO or LPS. GBX15 and GBX10 enhanced SWS. GBX15 significantly improved sTST, sWASO, sTSO, and sNAW at weeks 1 and 4. 2) Elderly study. GBX10 significantly improved WASO through nights 29/30; a significant improvement was also seen for GBX5 at nights 1/2 but this was not maintained through nights 29/30. GBX10 significantly improved LPS at nights 1/2 but the improvement was not maintained through nights 29/30; no significant differences were seen for GBX5 versus placebo on LPS. GBX10 and GBX5 enhanced SWS. GBX10 significantly improved sTST at week 1, and sTST, sWASO, and sNAW at week 4. Gaboxadol was generally well tolerated in both studies., CONCLUSIONS: The maximum studied doses of gaboxadol (GBX15 in adult patients and GBX10 in elderly patients) were effective at enhancing objective polysomnography measures of sleep maintenance and SWS, and also some subjective sleep measures, over 30 nights but had little or no effects on sleep onset.

We did a phase II study to establish efficacy and physiological mechanism, and a phase III study to confirm efficacy of the melatonin agonist tasimelteon (VEC-162) for treatment of transient insomnia associated with shifted sleep and wake time., METHODS: We undertook phase II and phase III randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies. In a phase II study, 39 healthy individuals from two US sites were randomly assigned to tasimelteon (10 [n=9], 20 [n=8], 50 [n=7], or 100 mg [n=7]) or placebo (n=8). We monitored individuals for 7 nights: 3 at baseline, 3 after a 5-h advance of sleep-wake schedule with treatment before sleep, and 1 after treatment; we measured plasma melatonin concentration for circadian phase assessment. In a phase III study, 411 healthy individuals from 19 US sites, who had transient insomnia induced in a sleep clinic by a 5-h advance of the sleep-wake schedule and a first-night effect in a sleep clinic, were given tasimelteon (20 [n=100], 50 [n=102], or 100 mg [n=106]) or placebo (n=103) 30 min before bedtime. Prespecified primary efficacy outcomes were polysomnographic sleep efficiency (phase II study), latency to persistent sleep (phase III study), and circadian phase shifting (phase II study). Analysis was by intention to treat. Safety was assessed in both studies. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00490945 and NCT00291187., FINDINGS: In the phase II study, tasimelteon reduced sleep latency and increased sleep efficiency compared with placebo. The shift in plasma melatonin rhythm to an earlier hour was dose dependent. In the phase III study, tasimelteon improved sleep latency, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset (ie, sleep maintenance). The frequency of adverse events was similar between tasimelteon and placebo., INTERPRETATION: After an abrupt advance in sleep time, tasimelteon improved sleep initiation and maintenance concurrently with a shift in endogenous circadian rhythms.

The aim of the current study was therefore to evaluate the effect of a newer hypnotic on sleep structure and clinical parameters in RA. Forty outpatients were randomized to a two week treatment regimen with either 7.5 mg zopiclone or placebo at bedtime. Clinical examinations were performed before and after treatment and the degree of pain, fatigue, sleepiness, morning stiffness, and activities of daily living were assessed. Two sleep questionnaires were also completed weekly. Polysomnography was performed before the study and after 14 days of treatment. Recordings were evaluated using conventional sleep scoring as well as frequency analysis of the electroencephalography (EEG). Patients in the zopiclone group had subjective improvement of sleep, but otherwise no differences in pain score or the other clinical parameters were found. Conventional sleep assessments showed only minor changes during treatment, but frequency analysis demonstrated a shift from the lower towards the higher EEG frequencies in the active treatment group. Although the modulation of the EEG can represent a non-specific pharmacologic epiphenomenon, it might also reflect a disturbance of sleep microstructure. In conclusion, treatment with zopiclone may be of value for subjective sleep complaints in selected patients with RA, but it is doubtful whether hypnotics improve daytime symptoms in this patient group.",1998,2022-08-24T07:19:42Z,2022-08-24T07:19:42Z,1998-01-01,180,NA,3,27,NA,Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00688507,"*Arthritis, Rheumatoid/co [Complications]; *Hypnotics and Sedatives/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Piperazines/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Sleep Wake Disorders/dt [Drug Therapy]; Adult; Azabicyclo Compounds; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outpatients; Polysomnography/de [Drug Effects]; Sleep Wake Disorders/et [Etiology]; Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Subjects had AMBPs and OT while hospitalized on four occasions: during the placebo run-in and subsequent to the first dose of 1, 2 and 5 mg TER or at corresponding times under TAM. Regular OT (blood pressure after 5 min supine and after 2 min standing) was carried out between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m.; 'nocturial' OT took place whenever the subject had to leave the bed at night to void., RESULTS: The baseline blood pressure values were slightly higher in the TAM group, but under treatment there was little difference between the treatments with regard to circadian changes in AMBP and HR. Under TER, there were 10 incidents of symptomatic hypotensive OT in 9 subjects (2 with syncope); furthermore, there were 24 events of asymptomatic exaggerated (> or = 20 mm Hg) decrease in systolic blood pressure in 12 subjects. With TAM in contrast, there was only 1 subject who experienced symptomatic hypotensive OT on 3 occasions (this subject had a previous history of vertigo and ought not to have been included); 7 subjects on TAM showed 16 incidents of asymptomatic hypotensive OT. The difference between TER and TAM was statistically significant for the number of subjects with positive symptomatic OT (p = 0.011)., CONCLUSION: Once-daily dosing of TAM after breakfast at a fixed dose level (0.4 mg) offers a more efficient protection against undesired cardiovascular extension effects in the normotensive elderly treated for LUTS suggestive of BPO than the usually recommended treatment schedule of TER with step-up doses (1-5 mg) administered at night.",1998,2022-08-24T07:19:42Z,2022-08-24T07:19:42Z,1998-01-01,481,NA,5,33,NA,European urology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00688543,"*Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]; *Heart Rate/de [Drug Effects]; *Hypotension, Orthostatic/pc [Prevention & Control]; *Prazosin/aa [Analogs & Derivatives]; *Sulfonamides/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Urinary Retention/dt [Drug Therapy]; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/ae [Adverse Effects]; Aged; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Circadian Rhythm; Double-Blind Method; Drug Administration Schedule; Humans; Hypotension, Orthostatic/ci [Chemically Induced]; Male; Middle Aged; Prazosin/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Prazosin/ae [Adverse Effects]; Prostatic Hyperplasia/co [Complications]; Sulfonamides/ae [Adverse Effects]; Tamsulosin; Urinary Retention/et [Etiology]; Urodynamics/de [Drug Effects]; Vertigo/ci [Chemically Induced]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet to be determined is whether this administration time-dependent efficacy is a class-related feature, characteristic of all angiotensin receptor blockers or specific only to valsartan. Terminal half-life is a major difference between angiotensin receptor blockers, being largest ( approximately 24 hours) for telmisartan. This trial investigated the administration time-dependent antihypertensive efficacy of telmisartan. We studied 215 patients with hypertension (114 men and 101 women), 46.4+/-12.0 years of age, randomly assigned to receive telmisartan (80 mg/d) as a monotherapy either on awakening or at bedtime. Blood pressure was measured for 48 hours before and after 12 weeks of treatment. The significant blood pressure reduction after treatment was similar for both groups. Bedtime administration of telmisartan, however, was more efficient than morning dosing in reducing the nocturnal blood pressure mean. The sleep time-relative blood pressure decline was slightly reduced after telmisartan on awakening but significantly increased with bedtime dosing, thus reducing the prevalence of nondipping from baseline by 76%. Telmisartan administered at bedtime, as opposed to morning dosing, improved the sleep time-relative blood pressure decline toward a more dipper pattern without loss in 24-hour efficacy. Nocturnal BP regulation is significantly better achieved with bedtime dosing of telmisartan. Results from this prospective trial suggest that these beneficial features of bedtime dosing may be class related for angiotensin receptor blockers. These results should be taken into account when prescribing this class of antihypertensive medication for treatment of essential hypertension.",2007,2022-08-24T07:19:42Z,2022-08-24T07:19:42Z,2007-01-01,715,NA,4,50,NA,"Hypertension (dallas, tex. :",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00701098,"*Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Benzimidazoles/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Benzoates/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Circadian Rhythm/ph [Physiology]; *Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; Adult; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Hypertension/pp [Physiopathology]; Male; Middle Aged; Telmisartan; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

All subjects underwent an overnight polysomnography in the sleep laboratory after one adaptation night, as a baseline evaluation; children with OSAS were recorded again after one year of RME treatment., RESULTS: After one year of treatment the OSAS group showed a longer duration of time in bed and sleep period time, a reduction in number of stage shifts compared to baseline recordings, and the apnea-hypopnea index decreased significantly. At baseline, the OSAS group had a higher CAP rate during slow-wave sleep and an increased A2 index compared to normal controls. After one year of RME application, children with OSAS showed an increase in CAP rate associated with an increase of A1 index during slow-wave sleep., CONCLUSIONS: RME treatment almost normalized sleep architecture and improved sleep respiratory disturbances; however, sleep microstructure and respiratory parameters did not completely recover. The persistence of increased CAP rate in slow-wave sleep associated with an increase of A1 index might reflect a partial failure of orthodontic treatment.

Administration of caffeine can therefore be used in healthy volunteers to mimic the effects of insomnia and thus to test the hypnotic effects of medication. This study assessed the effects of caffeine on sleep architecture and electroencephalography (EEG) spectrum alone and in combination with two different sleep-promoting medications. Home polysomnography was performed in 12 healthy male volunteers in a double-blind study whereby subjects received placebo, caffeine (150 mg), caffeine plus zolpidem (10 mg) and caffeine plus trazodone (100 mg) at bedtime in a randomised crossover design. In addition to delaying sleep onset, caffeine decreased total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE) and stage 2 sleep without significantly altering wake after sleep onset or the number of awakenings. Zolpidem attenuated the caffeine-induced decrease in SE and increased spindle density in the caffeine plus zolpidem combination compared with placebo. Trazodone attenuated the decrease in SE and TST, and it also increased stage 3 sleep, decreased the number of awakenings and decreased the spindle density. No significant changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were observed, neither was any significant alteration in slow wave activity nor other EEG spectral measures, although the direction of change was similar to that previously reported for caffeine and appeared to 'normalise' after trazodone. These data suggest that caffeine mimics some, but not all of the sleep disruption seen in insomnia and that its disruptive effects are differentially attenuated by the actions of sleep-promoting compounds with distinct mechanisms of action.",2009,2022-08-24T07:19:42Z,2022-08-24T07:19:42Z,2009-01-01,487,NA,5,23,NA,"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00718771,*Caffeine/to [Toxicity]; *Central Nervous System Stimulants/to [Toxicity]; *Hypnotics and Sedatives/pd [Pharmacology]; *Sleep Stages/de [Drug Effects]; Adult; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Electroencephalography; Humans; Male; Polysomnography; Pyridines/pd [Pharmacology]; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/ci [Chemically Induced]; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/dt [Drug Therapy]; Trazodone/pd [Pharmacology]; Young Adult; Zolpidem,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is not clear how best to reduce the frequency and duration of desaturation., OBJECTIVE: To study the management of desaturation episodes using two bedside algorithms., METHODS: Using a randomised crossover design, over two 8-hour periods, episodes were managed with either titration of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) alone or adjustment to ventilator pressures with smaller changes to FiO(2). Functional oxygen saturation and heart rate were downloaded from the bedside monitor. Ventilator parameters were captured simultaneously. The primary outcome was the proportion of time in the target saturation band. A cumulative measure of desaturation and oversaturation was also developed to compare groups., RESULTS: 33 studies were performed in 23 ventilated infants <32 weeks' gestation. Infants spent 51% of the time with saturations in the target band. There were more changes in ventilator pressure when the second algorithm was in use.

Four pramipexole doses were evaluated: 0.125, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75mg/d. Data from 107 patients were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis., RESULTS: For pramipexole recipients, the primary outcome measure, PLM per hour in bed asleep or awake (the PLM index, or PLMI), decreased by a median of -26.55 to -52.70 depending on dosage group, vs. -3.00 for placebo (p<0.01 or 0.001 for each group vs. placebo; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Improvements in the secondary endpoints of PLM while asleep and while awake were also significantly superior for pramipexole. At 3 weeks, all pramipexole doses reduced the median for PLM while asleep to levels considered normal (<5PLM/h). Except for delta-sleep time and awakenings/arousals, sleep parameters remained unchanged or favored pramipexole. Median sleep latency was reduced by -5.00 to -11.75min in the pramipexole groups, vs. -2.00 for placebo (p<0.05 for all groups except 0.25mg/d). Median total sleep time increased by 25.75-66.75min, vs. 25.50 (p<0.05 for 0.50mg/d), and median time in stages 2-4/rapid eye movement (REM) sleep increased by 37.00-68.00min, vs. 26.75 (p<0.05 for 0.50mg/d). By subjective IRLS ratings, all pramipexole doses were significantly superior to placebo. Safety analysis demonstrated no dose-dependent increase in adverse events, and no drug-related increase in daytime somnolence was observed., CONCLUSIONS: Pramipexole is effective and well tolerated in RLS, most notably among objective measures, for reducing PLM and decreasing sleep latency.

In studies of mothers and their infants, maternal skin-to-skin contact has been shown to decrease procedural pain response according to both behavioral and physiological indicators in very preterm neonates. It is uncertain if this comfort is derived solely from maternal presence or from stabilization of regulatory processes from direct skin contact. The intent of this study is to compare the comfort effect of co-bedding (between twin infants who are co-bedding and those who are not) on infant pain response and physiologic stability during a tissue breaking procedure (heelstick)., METHODS/DESIGN: Medically stable preterm twin infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit will be randomly assigned to a co-bedding group or a standard care group. Pain response will be measured by physiological and videotaped facial reaction using the Premature Infant Pain Profile scale (PIPP). Recovery from the tissue breaking procedure will be determined by the length of time for heart rate and oxygen saturation to return to baseline. Sixty four sets of twins (n = 128) will be recruited into the study. Analysis and inference will be based on the intention-to-treat principle., DISCUSSION: If twin contact while co-bedding is determined to have a comforting effect for painful procedures, then changes in current neonatal care practices to include co-bedding may be an inexpensive, non invasive method to help maintain physiologic stability and decrease the long term psychological impact of procedural pain in this high risk population. Knowledge obtained from this study will also add to existing theoretical models with respect to the exact mechanism of comfort through touch., TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00917631.",2009,2022-08-24T07:19:43Z,2022-08-24T07:19:43Z,2009-01-01,76,NA,NA,9,NA,BMC pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00728042,"*Infant Care/mt [Methods]; *Intensive Care, Neonatal/mt [Methods]; *Monitoring, Physiologic/mt [Methods]; *Pain/pc [Prevention & Control]; Codependency, Psychological; Humans; Incubators, Infant; Infant, Newborn; Intensive Care, Neonatal/px [Psychology]; Pain Measurement; Pain/px [Psychology]; Punctures; Twins",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This trial investigated the antihypertensive efficacy and effects on the morning BP surge of awakening versus bedtime administration of nifedipine in essential hypertension., METHODS: We studied 238 previously untreated hypertensive patients (108 men and 130 women), 53.3+/-11.4 years of age, randomly assigned to receive nifedipine (30 mg/day) as a monotherapy either upon awakening or at bedtime. BP was measured for 48 h before and after 8 weeks of treatment., RESULTS: The BP reduction after the treatment was significantly greater with bedtime dosing (P<0.001). The proportion of patients with controlled ambulatory BP thus increased from 28 to 43% (P = 0.019) with bedtime treatment. The sleep time relative BP decline was unchanged after morning treatment, but increased toward a more dipping pattern after bedtime dosing (P = 0.026 between groups). The morning BP surge was unchanged after the administration of nifedipine upon awakening (1.4/1.2 mmHg reduction in systolic/diastolic BP surge, P>0.270), but significantly reduced after bedtime dosing (6.2/4.4 mmHg reduction, P<0.001)., CONCLUSION: Nifedipine efficiently reduces BP for the entire 24 h and to a significantly larger extent after bedtime administration. The significant added efficacy on reducing night-time BP, the decrease in the prevalence of a nondipper BP pattern, and the significant decrease in morning BP surge (all relevant markers of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality) of bedtime as compared with morning administration, consistently indicate that nifedipine should preferably be administered at bedtime in patients with essential hypertension.",2009,2022-08-24T07:19:43Z,2022-08-24T07:19:43Z,2009-01-01,152,NA,4,14,NA,Blood pressure monitoring,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00731348,"*Antihypertensive Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Hypertension/pp [Physiopathology]; *Nifedipine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Sleep/ph [Physiology]; *Wakefulness/ph [Physiology]; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; Time Factors; Wakefulness/de [Drug Effects]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the acute effects of MDMA on sleep and daytime sleepiness have not been studied under placebo-controlled conditions. This study was designed to establish the effects of acute MDMA or placebo administration and sleep restriction on sleep and daytime sleepiness., DESIGN: Participants with a history of MDMA use were studied on 3 sessions of 3 nights (baseline, treatment, and recovery) and 2 days (following night 2 and 3) per session. On treatment nights (night 2), participants received placebo or 2 mg/kg of MDMA or underwent a restricted bed schedule with placebo. Sleep restriction was a positive control to compare sleep loss and consequent sleepiness associated with MDMA use. The scheduled sleep period was 8 hours long on nonrestricted nights, and standard sleep recordings and daytime sleepiness tests were conducted. Age-matched controls received 1 night and day of standard sleep and daytime sleepiness testing., SETTING: Sleep laboratory., PARTICIPANTS: Seven recreational MDMA-users and 13 matched control subjects., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Acute MDMA shortened sleep primarily by increasing sleep latency, and it reduced stage 3/4 sleep and suppressed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The MDMA-reduced sleep time was not associated with increased daytime sleepiness the following day, as was seen in the sleep-restriction condition. Compared with control subjects, the MDMA users on the first night in the laboratory had shorter total sleep times and less stage 3/4 sleep. Average daily sleep latency on daytime sleepiness tests the day after nighttime placebo administration was increased in MDMA users compared with the control subjects, and MDMA users had an elevated number of sleep-onset REM periods on these tests, compared with control subjects., CONCLUSIONS: Acute MDMA administration disrupts sleep and REM sleep, specifically, without producing daytime sleepiness such as sleep restriction does. Compared with control subjects, recreational MDMA users showed evidence of hyperarousal and impaired REM function. The mechanism behind these effects is likely due to the deleterious effects of MDMA on catecholamines.",2009,2022-08-24T07:19:43Z,2022-08-24T07:19:43Z,2009-01-01,1513,NA,11,32,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00731760,"*Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/pd [Pharmacology]; *Amphetamine-Related Disorders/px [Psychology]; *N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine/pd [Pharmacology]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; *Wakefulness/de [Drug Effects]; Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Adult; Amphetamine-Related Disorders/co [Complications]; Amphetamine-Related Disorders/pp [Physiopathology]; Cohort Studies; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; N-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Polysomnography; Recovery of Function; Time Factors; Young Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Thirty-six young healthy habitual nappers (18 men, 18 women) aged 18-23 participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions: to nap in a seat (NS), to nap in a bed (NB) and no-nap (NN). Measures of subjective sleepiness, mood, fatigue, and P300 component were taken before and after a 20min nap. Results showed that sleepiness, fatigue, and mood for both NS and NB were improved after napping. Moreover, objective alertness was enhanced in NB relative to NS and NN, which showed the larger P300 amplitude after nap. The delta power during sleep stage 2 of NS was inferior to that of NB, which induced a lower alertness after the sitting nap. Consequently, the result demonstrated the function of delta wave during stage 2 on arousal level following the brief midday nap.

Sleep curtailment is increasingly common in adolescents. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of short-term sleep curtailment on declarative memory consolidation in adolescents.

Twenty-two healthy subjects, aged 14-16 years, spent three consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory with a bedtime of 9 h during the first night (adaptation), 4 h during the second (partial sleep curtailment) and 9 h during the third night (recovery). The control condition consisted of three consecutive nights with bedtimes of 9 h. Both experimental conditions were separated by at least 3 weeks. The acquisition phase for the declarative tests was between 16:00 and 18:00 hours before the second night. Memory performance was examined in the morning after the recovery night. Executive function, attention and concentration were also assessed to control for any possible effects of tiredness.

Partial sleep curtailment of one night did not influence declarative memory retrieval significantly. Recall in the paired-associate word list task was correlated positively with percentage of non-REM sleep in the recovery night.

Amlodipine, however, has been shown to be effective in reducing BP throughout the day and night, independent of dosing time. A large proportion of hypertensive subjects cannot be properly controlled with a single medication. However, no study has yet investigated the potential differing effects of combination therapy depending of the time-of-day of administration. Accordingly, the authors investigated the administration-time-dependent BP-lowering efficacy of valsartan/amlodipine combination. The authors studied 203 hypertensive subjects (92 men/111 women), 56.7 +/- 12.5 yrs of age, randomized to receive valsartan (160 mg/day) and amlodipine (5 mg/day) in one of the following four therapeutic schemes: both medications on awakening, both at bedtime, either one administered on awakening and the other at bedtime. BP was measured by ambulatory monitoring for 48 consecutive hours before and after 12 wks of treatment. Physical activity was simultaneously monitored every min by wrist actigraphy to accurately determine the beginning and end of daytime activity and nocturnal sleep. BP-lowering efficacy (quantified in terms of reduction of the 48-h mean of systolic/diastolic BP) was highest when both hypertension medications were ingested at bedtime, as compared to any one of the three other tested therapeutic schemes (17.4/13.4 mm Hg reduction with both medications on awakening; 15.1/9.6 mm Hg with valsartan on awakening and amlodipine at bedtime; 18.2/12.3 mm Hg with valsartan at bedtime and amlodipine on awakening; 24.7/13.5 mm Hg with both medications at bedtime; p < .018 between groups). The sleep-time relative BP decline was significantly increased towards a more normal dipper pattern only when both medications were jointly ingested at bedtime (p < .001). Bedtime dosing of the combination of the two medications also resulted in the largest percentage of controlled subjects among all the assessed therapeutic schemes (p = .003 between groups). In subjects requiring combination therapy to achieve proper BP control, the association of amlodipine and valsartan efficiently reduces BP for the entire 24 h independent of dosing time. However, the greater proportion of controlled patients, improved efficacy on lowering asleep BP mean, and increased sleep-time relative BP decline suggest valsartan/amlodipine combination therapy should be preferably administered at bedtime.",2010,2022-08-24T07:19:44Z,2022-08-24T07:19:44Z,2010-01-01,1287,NA,6,27,NA,Chronobiology international,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00761598,"*Amlodipine/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Antihypertensive Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Tetrazoles/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Valine/aa [Analogs & Derivatives]; Adult; Aged; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]; Calcium Channel Blockers/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Circadian Rhythm/ph [Physiology]; Drug Chronotherapy; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Hypertension/pp [Physiopathology]; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Sleep/ph [Physiology]; Valine/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Valsartan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Sleepiness produced by sleep restriction leads to increased nociceptive sensitivity, suggesting opioid analgesia may also be modulated by sleepiness-alertness. This study compared thermal nociceptive sensitivity in sleepy versus nonsleepy participants after codeine or placebo. Twelve healthy normal adults, 18 to 35 years of age, had an 8-hr nocturnal polysomnogram (NPSG) followed by a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT; Carskadon and Dement, 1987). All had sleep efficiencies > 80% on their NPSG; 6 had average MSLT >or= 8 min (nonsleepy group) and 6 had latencies < 8 min (sleepy group). Participants were assessed following 8-hr time-in-bed with standard MSLT, and nociceptive assessments (using a radiant heat stimulation method) were conducted the following day with codeine 30 mg b.i.d. (0900 and 1300) or placebo b.i.d. Finger withdrawal latency (FWL) in seconds was measured to 5 different heat intensities randomly presented to the index finger pad of each hand. Mean +/- 1 SD MSLT values in the sleepy group were 4.72 +/- 1.83 min and 13.04 +/- 4.90 min in the nonsleepy group. As hypothesized, increased FWL (decreased nociception) was observed with lower heat intensities, codeine, and in the nonsleepy group. More important, there was a Group x Drug interaction with codeine increasing FWL in the nonsleepy, but not the sleepy, group. These data show the analgesic effects of codeine are diminished in sleepy versus nonsleepy individuals.

The aims of this study were to assess the effects of temazepam on indices of circadian respiratory function, dyspnea, sleep quality, and sleepiness in patients with severe COPD and insomnia., METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 14 stable patients with COPD (mean FEV(1) 0.99+/-0.3L) with insomnia, polysomnography with continuous transcutaneous capnography and oximetry, arterial gas sampling, hypercapnic ventilatory response, multiple sleep latency test, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, dyspnea and sleep visual analogue scales (VAS) were performed at baseline, after one week of temazepam 10mg at bedtime and after one week of placebo., RESULTS: Temazepam did not cause statistically significant changes in mean transcutaneous carbon dioxide tension during sleep compared to placebo (5.9+/-1.0 kPa vs. 6.3+/-1.4 kPa, p-value 0.27), nor in mean oxygen saturation (92+/-3% vs. 92+/-2%, p-value 0.31), nor in any of the other investigated variables, except for the total sleep time and sleep latency VAS, which improved with temazepam., CONCLUSIONS: One week usage of temazepam 10mg does not influence circadian respiratory function, dyspnea, and sleepiness in patients with stable, severe, normocapnic COPD and insomnia and it improves total sleep time and subjective sleep latency.

Children with CSOI (n = 72) received either melatonin 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 mg/kg or placebo during 1 week. Sleep was assessed with log and actigraphy during this week and the week before. Outcomes were the shifts in DLMO, SO, and SOL., RESULTS: Treatment with melatonin significantly advanced SO and DLMO by approximately 1 h and decreased SOL by 35 min. Within the three melatonin groups, effect size was not different, but the circadian time of administration (TOA) correlated significantly with treatment effect on DLMO (r (s) = -0.33, p = 0.022) and SO (r (s) = -0.38, p = 0.004), whereas clock TOA was correlated with SO shift (r = -0.35, p = 0.006) and not with DLMO shift., CONCLUSIONS: No dose-response relationship of melatonin with SO, SOL, and DLMO is found within a dosage range of 0.05-0.15 mg/kg. The effect of exogenous melatonin on SO, SOL, and DLMO increases with an earlier circadian TOA. The soporific effects of melatonin enhance the SO shift.

This study compared the respiratory effects of four commonly used devices., METHODS: A randomized crossover trial was undertaken in 27 healthy adults while suspended in single sling (SSling), double sling (DSling), supine in a rescue stretcher, and in a rescue basket (RB) of the type used by the U.S. Coast Guard. Primary variables measured were 1-s forced expiratory volume (FEVI), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio, and inspiratory capacity (IC) in each modality versus control. Secondary measurements were peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR)., RESULTS: Data meeting repeatability standards was obtained from at least 24 subjects in each position. The SSling was associated with significant mean decreases from control of 17% in FEV1, 19.8% in FVC, and 28.3% in IC, together with increases in HR and RR and a decrease in SpO2. The DSling and stretcher were associated with smaller decreases in expiratory spirometry; the DSling was associated with a >10% decrease in IC and the stretcher was associated with a >10% increase in IC.

CAP was scored to assess arousal instability between sleep-maintaining processes (phase A1) and stronger arousal processes (phases A2 and A3). Paired t-tests, ANOVAs, and cross-correlations were performed. Under clonidine, CAP time, and particularly the number of A3 phases, increased (P⩽0.01). RMMA/SB onset was time correlated with phases A2 and A3 for both placebo and clonidine nights (P⩽0.004). However, under clonidine, this positive correlation began up to 40 min before the RMMA/SB episode., CONCLUSIONS: CAP phase A3 frequency increased under clonidine, but paradoxically, RMMA/SB decreased.

Double blind placebo and alcohol (vodka tonic targeting 0.05g% concentration) beverages were each administered three times during FD at different homeostatic loads: low (4.25 or 2.24 hrs awake), medium (8.25 or 6.25 hrs awake), high (12.25 or 10.25 hrs awake) in the 0400 and 1600 or 1000 and 2200 groups, respectively. Sleep was staged and subjected to spectral analysis., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Breath Alcohol Concentration (BrAC) confirmed targeted maximal levels. At bedtime, BrAC was 0 in the low and medium homeostatic load conditions; however, at high homeostatic load, BrAC was still measurable. Spectral characteristics of sleep were unaffected with alcohol at any time of day. Few alcohol related changes were seen for sleep stages; however, with alcohol given at 0400 at a high homeostatic load there was an increase in wake., CONCLUSIONS: These data lend support to the idea that alcohol may be disruptive to sleep; however, our findings are inconsistent with the idea that a low dose of alcohol is a useful sleep aid when attempting to sleep at an adverse circadian phase.",2011,2022-08-24T07:19:45Z,2022-08-24T07:19:45Z,2011-01-01,195,NA,2,34,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00787474,"*Central Nervous System Depressants/pd [Pharmacology]; *Ethanol/pd [Pharmacology]; *Sleep Stages/de [Drug Effects]; Adult; Breath Tests; Central Nervous System Depressants/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Circadian Rhythm/de [Drug Effects]; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Electroencephalography/de [Drug Effects]; Ethanol/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Female; Humans; Male; Polysomnography/de [Drug Effects]; Reference Values; Saliva/de [Drug Effects]; Saliva/me [Metabolism]; Time Factors; Wakefulness/de [Drug Effects]; Young Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a community-based randomized controlled trial we evaluated whether physical exercise reduced IIV in self-rated sleep outcomes among middle-aged and older adults with sleep complaints. Under-active adults 55 years and older (n = 66, 67% women) with mild to moderate sleep complaints were randomized to 12 months of a moderate-intensity endurance exercise (n = 36) or a health education control group (n = 30). Daily sleep logs, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and in-home polysomnographic sleep recordings (PSG) were collected at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. Sleep log-derived means and IIV were computed for sleep-onset latency (SOL), time in bed, feeling rested in the morning, number of nighttime awakenings, and wake after final awakening (WAFA). Using intent-to-treat methods, at 6 months no differences in IIV were observed by group. At 12 months, SOL-based IIV was reduced in the exercise group compared with the control (difference = 23.11, 95% CI: 3.04-47.18, P = 0.025, Cohen's d = 0.57). This change occurred without mean-level or IIV changes in sleep-wake schedules. For all sleep variables, except SOL and WAFA, IIV changes and mean-level changes in each variable were negatively correlated (r = -0.312 to -0.691, P < 0.05). Sleep log-derived IIV changes were modestly correlated with mean-level PSQI and PSG-based changes at 12 months.

To obtain blood pressure (BP) target goals most patients require treatment with more than one hypertension medication. However, the potential differing effects on BP regulation of combination therapy depending on the time-of-day of administration have scarcely been investigated. Accordingly, the authors prospectively evaluated the administration-time-dependent BP-lowering efficacy of valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination therapy. The authors conducted a randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial on 204 subjects with essential hypertension (95 men/109 women), 49.7 ± 11.1 (mean ± SD) yrs of age. The BP of participants in this trial was not properly controlled with respect to published ambulatory BP criteria after initially randomized to valsartan monotherapy (160 mg/day), whether routinely ingested upon awakening by one group or at bedtime by another group for 12 wks. Thus, HCTZ (12.5 mg/day) was added to valsartan as a single-pill formulation, maintaining the original treatment-time, i.e., upon awakening or at bedtime, of participants of the two groups, for another 12 wks. BP was measured by ambulatory monitoring for 48 h at inclusion and after each 12-wk span of therapy. Physical activity was simultaneously monitored every minute by wrist actigraphy to accurately define the beginning and end of daytime activity and nocturnal sleep so that the respective BP means for every participant at each evaluation could be precisely determined. Combination therapy resulted in a similar statistically significant reduction of the 48-h BP mean from baseline for both treatment-time groups (17.0/11.5 mm Hg in systolic/diastolic BP after combination therapy on awakening; 17.9/12.1 mm Hg reduction after combination treatment at bedtime; p > .542 between groups). The awake BP mean was reduced to a comparable extent in both treatment-time groups (p > .682). However, bedtime compared to morning dosing better reduced the asleep means of systolic BP (20.1 vs. 16.0 mm Hg; p = .015) and pulse pressure (6.5 vs. 4.0 mm Hg; p = .007 between groups). Accordingly, the proportion of subjects with a baseline non-dipper BP profile was significantly reduced from 59% to 23% only after bedtime combination treatment (p < .001). Moreover, the proportion of subjects with properly controlled ambulatory BP after combination therapy was significantly greater with bedtime than upon-awakening treatment (55 vs. 40%, p = .037). The improved efficacy in lowering the asleep BP mean, increased sleep-time relative BP decline, and greater proportion of controlled patients suggest that valsartan/HCTZ combination should be preferably administered at bedtime for treatment of subjects with essential hypertension requiring combination therapy to achieve proper BP control.",2011,2022-08-24T07:19:45Z,2022-08-24T07:19:45Z,2011-01-01,601,NA,7,28,NA,Chronobiology international,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00806699,"*Antihypertensive Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Antihypertensive Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Hydrochlorothiazide/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Hydrochlorothiazide/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Tetrazoles/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Tetrazoles/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Valine/aa [Analogs & Derivatives]; Adult; Antihypertensive Agents/pd [Pharmacology]; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]; Circadian Rhythm/ph [Physiology]; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide/pd [Pharmacology]; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Sleep/ph [Physiology]; Tetrazoles/pd [Pharmacology]; Treatment Outcome; Valine/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Valine/pd [Pharmacology]; Valine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Valsartan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Polysomnography offers a modern methodology for evaluating the objective effects of taking homeopathic remedies that clinicians claim exert effects on sleep quality in susceptible individuals. Animal studies have previously shown changes in non rapid eye movement sleep with certain homeopathic remedies., METHODS: Young adults of both sexes (ages 18-31) with above-average scores on standardized personality scales for either cynical hostility or anxiety sensitivity (but not both) and a history of coffee-induced insomnia participated in the month-long study. At-home polysomnographic recordings were obtained on successive pairs of nights once per week for a total of eight recordings (nights 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23). Subjects (N=54) received placebo pellets on night 8 (single-blind) and verum pellets on night 22 (double-blind) in 30c doses of one of two homeopathic remedies, Nux Vomica or Coffea Cruda. Subjects completed daily morning sleep diaries and weekly Pittsburgh sleep quality index scales, as well as profile of mood states scales at bedtime on polysomnography nights., RESULTS: Verum remedies significantly increased PSG total sleep time and NREM, as well as awakenings and stage changes. Changes in actigraphic and self-rated scale effects were not significant., CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the feasibility of using in-home, all-night sleep recordings to study homeopathic remedy effects.

Effects of bedtime administration of zolpidem extended-release (ZOL; 12.5 mg) were tested on a battery of performance measures assessed during a forced nighttime awakening in 15 healthy male volunteers who completed overnight polysomnographic recording sessions in our laboratory at baseline and after approximately a month of at-home ZOL. As expected, bedtime ZOL administration was associated with changes in sleep architecture and impairments across all performance domains during nighttime testing (psychomotor function, attention, working memory, episodic memory, metacognition) with no residual next morning impairment. Tolerance did not develop to the observed ZOL-related impairments on any outcome. Possible evidence of acute abstinence effects after discontinuation of ZOL was observed on some performance and sleep outcomes. Overall, these findings suggest that performance is significantly impaired during nighttime awakening even after a month of nightly ZOL administration, and these impairments could significantly impact safety should nighttime awakening require unimpaired functioning (e.g., driving; combat-related activities in the military).",2012,2022-08-24T07:19:46Z,2022-08-24T07:19:46Z,2012-01-01,28,NA,1,20,NA,Experimental and clinical psychopharmacology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00833104,"*Cognition/de [Drug Effects]; *Hypnotics and Sedatives/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Psychomotor Performance/de [Drug Effects]; *Pyridines/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; Adult; Attention/de [Drug Effects]; Delayed-Action Preparations/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Double-Blind Method; Humans; Male; Memory, Episodic; Polysomnography/mt [Methods]; Time Factors; Young Adult; Zolpidem",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We evaluated in a subgroup cohort of MAPEC (Monitorización Ambulatoria para Predicción de Eventos Cardiovasculares, i.e., ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for prediction of cardiovascular events) with diabetes whether reduced cardiovascular risk is more related to the progressive decrease of awake vs. asleep BP., METHODS: We studied 607 patients with type 2 diabetes during a median 5.4 years follow-up.

In a 3-period, crossover trial, former participants of the African American Study of Kidney Disease were assigned to receive the following 3 regimens, each lasting 6 weeks, presented in random order: AM dose (once-daily antihypertensive medications taken in the morning), PM dose (once-daily antihypertensives taken at bedtime), and add-on dose (once-daily antihypertensives taken in the morning and an additional antihypertensive medication before bedtime [diltiazem 60-120 mg, hydralazine 25 mg, or additional ramipril 5 mg]). Ambulatory BP monitoring was performed at the end of each period. The primary outcome was nocturnal systolic BP. Mean age of the study population (n=147) was 65.4 years, 64% were men, and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 44.9 mL/min per 1.73 m(2).

Thus, it has been suggested that the relationship between BP and CVD events is J-shaped, with CVD risk decreasing as BP is lowered, and then rising as BP is further decreased. Correlation between BP level and CVD risk, however, is stronger for ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) than clinical BP measurements. We previously established that the hypertension treatment-time regimen, upon awakening versus at bedtime, exerts differential effect on BP control during the day and nighttime, which translates into a differential degree of CVD risk prevention. We, therefore, investigated the role of hypertension treatment-time scheme on the nature of the relationship between achieved clinic and ambulatory BP and CVD risk in the MAPEC (Monitorización Ambulatoria para Predicción de Eventos Cardiovasculares, i.e., Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring for Prediction of Cardiovascular Events) study, a prospective, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial on 2156 hypertensive patients (1044 men/1112 women), 55.6 ± 13.6 (mean ± SD) yrs of age, randomized to ingest all prescribed once-a-day hypertension medications upon awakening or the entire daily dose of ≥1 of them at bedtime. Ambulatory BP was measured for 48-h at baseline and annually thereafter, and more frequently (quarterly) when adjustment of treatment was necessary. After a median follow-up of 5.6 yrs, a J-shaped relationship was detected between total CVD events and clinic as well as awake BP mean, but only for the group of patients ingesting all medications upon awakening. The relationship was different in the group of patients who ingested ≥1 medications at bedtime; the risk of CVD events progressively diminished in a linear, rather than J-shaped, manner with treatment-induced decrease in awake BP mean. The adjusted hazard ratio of CVD events was significantly lower with the progressive reduction in the asleep BP mean, independent of the hypertension treatment-time regimen. There was no single major event, i.e., CVD death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, in patients who achieved an asleep systolic BP mean <103 mm Hg. Our findings indicate that bedtime hypertension treatment is not associated with a J-shaped relationship between achieved BP and CVD risk. The decreased CVD risk associated with the progressive reduction in asleep BP, more feasible by bedtime than morning hypertension treatment, has clinical implications, in particular, the need to consider the proper timing of hypertension medications, in conjunction with ABPM for proper assessment of BP control, as an improved and potentially safer means of reducing CVD risk of hypertensive patients.",2013,2022-08-24T07:19:46Z,2022-08-24T07:19:46Z,2013-01-01,328,NA,1-2,30,NA,Chronobiology international,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00862604,"*Cardiovascular Diseases/di [Diagnosis]; *Cardiovascular Diseases/pp [Physiopathology]; *Hypertension/pp [Physiopathology]; Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Antihypertensive Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory/mt [Methods]; Circadian Rhythm; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sleep; Time Factors",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nevertheless, the latter continue to be the ""gold standard"" to diagnose hypertension, assess CVD risk, and evaluate hypertension treatment. Independent ABPM studies have found that elevated sleep-time BP is a better predictor of CVD risk than either the awake or 24-h BP mean. A major limitation of all previous ABPM-based prognostic studies is the reliance only upon a single baseline profile from each participant at the time of inclusion, without accounting for potential changes in the level and pattern of ambulatory BP thereafter during follow-up. Accordingly, impact of the alteration over time, i.e., during long-term follow-up, of specific features of the 24-h BP variation on CVD risk has never been properly investigated. We evaluated the comparative prognostic value of (i) clinic and ambulatory BP; (ii) different ABPM-derived characteristics, e.g., asleep or awake BP mean; and (iii) specific changes in ABPM characteristic during follow-up, mainly whether reduced CVD risk is more related to the progressive decrease of asleep or awake BP. We prospectively studied 3344 subjects (1718 men/1626 women), 52.6 ± 14.5 (mean ± SD) yrs of age, during a median follow-up of 5.6 yrs. Those with hypertension at baseline were randomized to ingest all their prescribed hypertension medications upon awakening or ≥1 of them at bedtime. At baseline, BP was measured at 20-min intervals from 07:00 to 23:00 h and at 30-min intervals at night for 48-h, and physical activity was simultaneously monitored every min by wrist actigraphy to accurately derive awake and asleep BP means. Identical assessment was scheduled annually and more frequently (quarterly) if treatment adjustment was required. Data collected either at baseline or the last ABPM evaluation per participant showed that the asleep systolic BP mean was the most significant predictor of both total CVD events and major CVD events (a composite of CVD death, myocardial infarction, and stroke). Moreover, when the asleep BP mean was adjusted by the awake mean, only the former was a significant independent predictor of outcome in a Cox proportional-hazard model adjusted for sex, age, diabetes, anemia, and chronic kidney disease. Analyses of changes in ambulatory BP during follow-up revealed 17% reduction in CVD risk for each 5 mm Hg decrease in the asleep systolic BP mean (p < .001), independent of changes in any other clinic or ambulatory BP parameter. The increased event-free survival associated with the progressive reduction in the asleep systolic BP mean during follow-up was significant for subjects with either normal or elevated BP at baseline. The ABPM-derived asleep BP mean was the most significant prognostic marker of CVD morbidity and mortality. Most important, the progressive decrease in asleep BP mean, a novel therapeutic target that requires proper patient evaluation by ABPM and best achieved by ingestion of at least one hypertension medication at bedtime, was the most significant predictor of event-free survival.",2013,2022-08-24T07:19:46Z,2022-08-24T07:19:46Z,2013-01-01,68,NA,1-2,30,NA,Chronobiology international,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00863561,"*Antihypertensive Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]; *Cardiovascular Diseases/co [Complications]; *Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Arterial Pressure; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Cardiovascular Diseases/di [Diagnosis]; Circadian Rhythm; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Rate; Humans; Hypertension/co [Complications]; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Sleep",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Normotensive persons with a non-dipper BP profile also have increased target organ damage, namely, increased left ventricular mass and relative wall thickness, reduced myocardial diastolic function, increased urinary albumin excretion, increased prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, and impaired glucose tolerance. It remains a point of contention, however, whether the non-dipper BP pattern or just elevated BP, alone, is the most important predictor of advanced target organ damage and future CVD events. Accordingly, we investigated the role of dipping status and ambulatory BP level as contributing factors for CVD morbidity and mortality in the MAPEC (Monitorización Ambulatoria para Predicción de Eventos Cardiovasculares, i.e., Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring for Prediction of Cardiovascular Events) study. We prospectively studied 3344 individuals (1718 men/1626 women), 52.6 ± 14.5 (mean ± SD) yrs of age, during a median follow-up of 5.6 yrs. BP was measured by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) for 48 h at baseline, and again annually or more frequently (quarterly) if treatment adjustment was required in treated hypertensive patients. At baseline, those with ABPM-substantiated hypertension were randomized to one of two treatment-time regimen groups: (i) ingestion of all prescribed hypertension medications upon awakening or (ii) ingestion of the entire dose of ≥1 of them at bedtime. Those found to be normotensive at baseline were untreated but followed and evaluated by repeated ABPM like the hypertensive patients. Participants were divided into four investigated categories on the basis of dipping status and ambulatory BP: (i) dipper vs. non-dipper, and (ii) normal ambulatory BP if the awake systolic (SBP)/diastolic (DBP) BP means were <135/85 mm Hg and the asleep SBP/DBP means were <120/70 mm Hg, and elevated ambulatory BP otherwise. Cox survival analyses, adjusted for significant confounding variables, documented that non-dippers had significantly higher CVD risk than dippers, whether they had normal (p = .017) or elevated ambulatory BP (p < .001). Non-dippers with normal awake and asleep SBP and DBP means, who accounted for 21% of the studied population, had similar hazard ratio (HR) of CVD events (1.61 [95% confidence interval, CI: 1.09-2.37]) as dippers with elevated ambulatory BP (HR: 1.54 [95% CI: 1.01-2.36]; p = .912 between groups). These results remained mainly unchanged for treated and untreated patients analyzed separately. Our findings document that the risk of CVD events is influenced not only by ambulatory BP elevation, but also by blunted nighttime BP decline, even within the normotensive range, thus supporting ABPM as a requirement for proper CVD risk assessment in the general population. The elevated CVD risk in ""normotensive"" individuals with a non-dipper BP profile represents a clear paradox, as those persons do not have ""normal BP"" or low CVD risk. Our findings also indicate the need to redefine the concepts of normotension/hypertension, so far established on the unique basis of BP level, mainly if not exclusively measured at the clinic, independently of circadian BP pattern.",2013,2022-08-24T07:19:46Z,2022-08-24T07:19:46Z,2013-01-01,87,NA,1-2,30,NA,Chronobiology international,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00863567,"*Blood Pressure/ph [Physiology]; *Cardiovascular Diseases/co [Complications]; Actigraphy; Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Antihypertensive Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Blood Pressure/de [Drug Effects]; Circadian Rhythm; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypertension/co [Complications]; Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Myocardium/pa [Pathology]; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Sleep; Time Factors",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is based on studies in which BP was sampled every 15-30 min for ⩽24 h, without taking into account that reproducibility of any estimated parameter from a time series to be potentially used for CVD risk assessment might depend more on monitoring duration than on sampling rate. Herein, we evaluated the influence of duration (48 vs. 24 h) and sampling rate of BP measurements (form every 20-30 min up to every 2 h) on the prognostic value of ABPM-derived parameters. We prospectively studied 3344 subjects (1718 men/1626 women), 52.6 ± 14.5 yrs of age, during a median follow-up of 5.6 yrs. Those with hypertension at baseline were randomized to ingest all their prescribed hypertension medications upon awakening or ≥1 of them at bedtime. At baseline, BP was measured at 20-min intervals from 07:00 to 23:00 h and at 30-min intervals at night for 48 h, and physical activity was simultaneously monitored every min by wrist actigraphy to accurately derive the awake and asleep BP means. Identical assessment was scheduled annually and more frequently (quarterly) if treatment adjustment was required. ABPM profiles were modified to generate time series of identical 48-h duration but with data sampled at 1- or 2-h intervals, or shorter, i.e., first 24 h, time series with data sampled at the original rate (daytime 20-min intervals/nighttime 30-min intervals). Bland-Altman plots indicated that the range of individual differences in the estimated awake and asleep systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) means between the original and modified ABPM profiles was up to 3-fold smaller for data sampled every 1 h for 48 h than for data sampled every 20-30 min for the first 24 h. Reduction of ABPM duration to just 24 h resulted in error of the estimated asleep SBP mean, the most significant prognostic marker of CVD events, in the range of -21.4 to +23.9 mm Hg. Cox proportional-hazard analyses adjusted for sex, age, diabetes, anemia, and chronic kidney disease revealed comparable hazard ratios (HRs) for mean BP values and sleep-time relative BP decline derived from the original complete 48-h ABPM profiles and those modified to simulate a sampling rate of one BP measurement every 1 or 2 h. The HRs, however, were markedly overestimated for SBP and underestimated for DBP when the duration of ABPM was reduced from 48 to only 24 h. This study on subjects evaluated prospectively by 48-h ABPM documents that reproducibility in the estimates of prognostic ABPM-derived parameters depends markedly on duration of monitoring, and only to a lesser extent on sampling rate. The HR of CVD events associated with increased ambulatory BP is poorly estimated by relying on 24-h ABPM, indicating ABPM for only 24 h may be insufficient for proper diagnosis of hypertension, identification of dipping status, evaluation of treatment efficacy, and, most important, CVD risk stratification.",2013,2022-08-24T07:19:46Z,2022-08-24T07:19:46Z,2013-01-01,55,NA,1-2,30,NA,Chronobiology international,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00863569,"*Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory/mt [Methods]; *Cardiovascular Diseases/di [Diagnosis]; *Cardiovascular Diseases/pp [Physiopathology]; Actigraphy; Adult; Aged; Circadian Rhythm; Diastole; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypertension/di [Diagnosis]; Hypertension/pp [Physiopathology]; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Reproducibility of Results; Sleep; Systole; Time Factors; Wakefulness",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We hypothesized that increasing sleep duration serves as an effective behavioral strategy to reduce blood pressure in prehypertension or type 1 hypertension. Twenty-two participants with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension, and habitual sleep durations of 7 h or less, participated in a 6-week intervention study. Subjects were randomized to a sleep extension group (48 ± 12 years, N = 13) aiming to increase bedtime by 1 h daily over a 6-week intervention period, or to a sleep maintenance group (47 ± 12 years, N = 9) aiming to maintain habitual bedtimes. Both groups received sleep hygiene instructions. Beat-to-beat blood pressure was monitored over 24 h, and 24-h urine and a fasting blood sample were collected pre- and post-intervention. Subjects in the sleep extension group increased their actigraphy-assessed daily sleep duration by 35 ± 9 min, while subjects in the sleep maintenance condition increased slightly by 4 ± 9 min (P = 0.03 for group effect). Systolic and diastolic beat-to-beat blood pressure averaged across the 24-h recording period significantly decreased from pre- to post-intervention visit in the sleep extension group by 14 ± 3 and 8 ± 3 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.05). Though the reduction of 7 ± 5 and 3 ± 4 mmHg in the sleep maintenance group was not significant, it did not differ from the blood pressure reduction in the sleep extension group (P = 0.15 for interaction effect). These changes were not paralleled by pre- to post-intervention changes in inflammatory or sympatho-adrenal markers, nor by changes in caloric intake.

In this pilot study, the investigators examined the effect of melatonin on seizures, sleep quality, and behavior in 10 patients aged 9 to 32 years with intractable epilepsy. Patients were randomized to receive melatonin (10 mg daily at bedtime) followed by placebo or placebo followed by melatonin for 3 weeks each, with a 1-week washout period in between. Seizure frequency was monitored by daily diaries and actigraphy recordings; behavioral and sleep parameters were rated by caregivers. Diurnal seizures decreased significantly with melatonin compared with placebo (P = .034, Wilcoxon test).

Although all chronotherapy trials have compared the effects on BP regulation of full daily doses of medications when ingested in the morning versus at bedtime, prescription of the same medications in divided doses twice daily (BID) is frequent. Here, we investigated the influence of hypertension treatment-time regimen on the circadian BP pattern, degree of BP control, and relevant clinical and laboratory medicine parameters of RH patients evaluated by 48-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). This cross-sectional study evaluated 2899 such patients (1701 men/1198 women), 64.2 ± 11.8 (mean ± SD) yrs of age, enrolled in the Hygia Project. Among the participants, 1084 were ingesting all hypertension medications upon awakening (upon-awakening regimen), 1436 patients were ingesting the full daily dose of ≥1 of them at bedtime (bedtime regimen), and 379 were ingesting split doses of ≥1 medications BID upon awakening and at bedtime (BID regimen). Patients of the bedtime regimen compared with the other two treatment-time regimens had lower likelihood of microalbuminuria and chronic kidney disease; significantly lower albumin/creatinine ratio, glucose, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol; plus higher estimated glomerular filtration rate and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The bedtime regimen was also significantly associated with lower asleep systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP means than the upon-awakening and BID regimens. The sleep-time relative SBP and DBP decline was significantly attenuated by the upon-awakening and BID regimens (p < .001), resulting in significantly higher prevalence of non-dipping in these two treatment-time regimen groups (80.5% and 77.3%, respectively) than in the bedtime regimen (54.4%; p < .001 between groups). Additionally, the prevalence of the riser BP pattern, associated with highest CVD risk, was much greater, 31.0% and 29.8%, respectively, among patients of the upon-awakening and BID-treatment regimens, compared with the bedtime regimen (17.6%; p < .001 between groups). Patients of the bedtime regimen also showed significantly higher prevalence of properly controlled ambulatory BP (p < .001) as a result of a greater proportion of them showing complete control of asleep SBP and DBP means. Our findings demonstrate significantly lower asleep SBP and DBP means and attenuated prevalence of blunted nighttime BP decline, i.e., lower prevalence of CVD risk markers, in RH patients ingesting the full daily dose of ≥1 hypertension medications at bedtime than in those ingesting all of them upon awakening or ≥1 of them as split doses BID. In RH, ingesting the same medications BID neither improves ambulatory BP control nor reduces the prevalence of non-dipping, and cannot be considered chronotherapy. Collectively, findings of this study indicate that a bedtime hypertension medication regimen, in conjunction with proper patient evaluation by ABPM to corroborate the diagnosis of true RH and avoid treatment-induced nocturnal hypotension, should be the therapeutic scheme of choice for patients who, by conventional cuff methods (and in the absence of ABPM) and the morning-treatment regimen, have been mistakenly judged to be resistant to therapy.",2013,2022-08-24T07:19:47Z,2022-08-24T07:19:47Z,2013-01-01,192,NA,1-2,30,NA,Chronobiology international,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00871034,"*Antihypertensive Agents/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory/mt [Methods]; *Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Blood Pressure; Circadian Rhythm; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Risk Factors; Time Factors",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most important, it was recently documented that routine ingestion of the full daily dose of ≥1 hypertension medications at bedtime, compared with ingestion of all of them upon awakening, significantly reduces cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Nocturnal hypertension and non-dipping (<10% decline in the asleep relative to the awake BP mean), as determined by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), are frequent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and both are associated with increased CVD risk. Here, we investigated the influence of hypertension treatment time on the circadian BP pattern and degree of BP control of hypertensive patients with CKD evaluated by 48-h ABPM. This cross-sectional study evaluated 2659 such patients (1585 men/1074 women), 64.9 ± 13.2 (mean ± SD) yrs of age, enrolled in the Hygia Project, involving primary care centers of northwest Spain and designed to evaluate prospectively CVD risk by ABPM; 1446 were ingesting all BP-lowering medications upon awakening, whereas 1213 patients were ingesting ≥1 medications at bedtime. Among the latter, 359 patients were ingesting all medications at bedtime, whereas 854 were ingesting the full daily dose of some medications upon awakening and the others at bedtime. Those ingesting all medications upon awakening had significantly higher total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol than those ingesting ≥1 medications at bedtime. Moreover, patients ingesting all medications at bedtime had the lowest fasting glucose, serum creatinine, and uric acid. Ingestion of ≥1 medications at bedtime was significantly associated with lower asleep systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP means than treatment with all medications upon awakening. The sleep-time relative SBP decline was significantly attenuated in patients ingesting all medications upon awakening (p < .001). Thus, the prevalence of non-dipping was significantly higher when all hypertension medications were ingested upon awakening (68.3%) than when ≥1 of them was ingested at bedtime (54.2%; p < .001 between groups), and even further attenuated (47.9%) when all of them were ingested at bedtime (p < .001). Additionally, the prevalence of a riser BP pattern, associated with highest CVD risk, was much greater (21.5%) among patients ingesting all medications upon awakening, compared with those ingesting some (15.7%) or all medications at bedtime (10.6%; p < .001 between groups), independent of CKD severity (disease stage). The latter group also showed a significantly higher prevalence of properly controlled ambulatory BP (p < .001) that was achieved by a significantly lower number of hypertension medications (p < .001) compared with patients treated upon awakening.

Moreover, the risks of long sleep have scarcely been examined experimentally. Moderate sleep restriction might benefit older long sleepers who often spend excessive time in bed (TIB) in contrast to older adults with average sleep patterns.

Eszopiclone (Lunesta), a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, acts on &ggr;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus where spindles are generated. We investigated whether eszopiclone could increase spindles and thereby improve memory consolidation in schizophrenia., DESIGN: In a double-blind design, patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or 3 mg of eszopiclone. Patients completed Baseline and Treatment visits, each consisting of two consecutive nights of polysomnography. On the second night of each visit, patients were trained on the motor sequence task (MST) at bedtime and tested the following morning., SETTING: Academic research center., PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one chronic, medicated schizophrenia outpatients., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We compared the effects of two nights of eszopiclone vs. placebo on stage 2 sleep spindles and overnight changes in MST performance. Eszopiclone increased the number and density of spindles over baseline levels significantly more than placebo, but did not significantly enhance overnight MST improvement. In the combined eszopiclone and placebo groups, spindle number and density predicted overnight MST improvement., CONCLUSION: Eszopiclone significantly increased sleep spindles, which correlated with overnight motor sequence task improvement. These findings provide partial support for the hypothesis that the spindle deficit in schizophrenia impairs sleep-dependent memory consolidation and may be ameliorated by eszopiclone. Larger samples may be needed to detect a significant effect on memory. Given the general role of sleep spindles in cognition, they offer a promising novel potential target for treating cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",2013,2022-08-24T07:19:47Z,2022-08-24T07:19:47Z,2013-01-01,1369,NA,9,36,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: Associated Professional Sleep Societies,LLC (2510 N.

Different trials have also shown that relatively low cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk cannot be achieved in high-risk hypertensive patients, leading to the belief they have a ""residual CVD risk"" that cannot be attenuated by conventional treatment. All these conclusions disregard the facts that the correlation between BP level and CVD risk is stronger for ambulatory than clinic BP and that the BP-lowering efficacy and effects on the 24-h BP pattern of different classes of hypertension medications exhibit statistically and clinically significant treatment-time (morning versus evening) differences. Accordingly, we evaluated the potential differential administration-time-dependent effects on CVD risk of the various classes of hypertension medications and the number of them used for therapy in the MAPEC (Monitorización Ambulatoria para Predicción de Eventos Cardiovasculares, i.e., Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring for Prediction of Cardiovascular Events) study, a prospective, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial on 2156 hypertensive patients (1044 men/1112 women), 55.6 ± 13.6 (mean ± SD) yrs of age, randomized to ingest all prescribed once-a-day hypertension medications upon awakening or the entire daily dose of ≥1 of them at bedtime. Ambulatory BP was measured for 48 h at baseline, and again annually or more frequently (quarterly) when adjustment of treatment was necessary to achieve ambulatory, i.e., awake and asleep, BP control. CVD risk according to the number and classes of medications used at the final evaluation was calculated by comparison with that of 734 normotensive subjects who were identically followed and remained untreated. After a median follow-up of 5.6 yrs, CVD risk of hypertensive patients randomized to ingest all medications upon awakening was progressively higher with increase in the number of medications (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.75, 2.26, 3.02, and 4.18 in patients treated with 1, 2, 3, and ≥4 medications daily, respectively; p < .001 compared with normotensive subjects). CVD risk was markedly lower in patients ingesting ≥1 medications at bedtime (HR: .35, 1.45, .94, and 2.28 with 1, 2, 3, and ≥4 medications daily, respectively), and even lower in patients ingesting all medications at bedtime (HR: .35, .39, .87, and .79 with 1, 2, 3, and ≥4 medications daily, respectively). Patients ingesting ≥1 medications at bedtime evidenced significantly lower CVD risk than those ingesting all medications upon awakening, independent of class. Greater benefits were observed for bedtime compared with awakening treatment with angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) (HR: .29 [95% confidence interval, CI .17-.51]; p < .001) and calcium channel blockers (HR: .46 [95% CI: .31-.69]; p < .001). CVD risk was similar for all six classes of tested hypertension medications in patients randomized to ingest all of them upon awakening. Among patients randomized to ingest ≥1 medications at bedtime, however, ARBs were associated with significantly lower HR of CVD events than ingestion of any other class of medication also at bedtime (p < .017). We document significantly reduced CVD risk among hypertensive patients ingesting medications at bedtime, independent of the number of hypertension medications required to achieve proper ambulatory BP control.

We aimed to derive diagnostic thresholds for the awake and asleep systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP means based upon CVD outcomes (death from all causes, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary revascularization, heart failure, acute arterial occlusion of the lower extremities, thrombotic occlusion of the retinal artery, hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack) for patients with and without diabetes. We prospectively studied 3344 subjects (1718 men/1626 women), 52.6 ± 14.5 (mean ± SD) yrs of age, 607 with type 2 diabetes, during a median follow-up of 5.6 yrs. Those with hypertension at baseline were randomized to ingest all their prescribed hypertension medications upon awakening or the entire daily dose of ≥1 of them at bedtime. At baseline, BP was measured at 20-min intervals from 07:00 to 23:00 h and at 30-min intervals at night for 48 h, and physical activity was simultaneously monitored every minute by wrist actigraphy to accurately derive the awake and asleep BP means. Identical assessment was scheduled annually and more frequently (quarterly) if treatment adjustment was required. Cox regression analysis was used to derive outcome-based reference thresholds for ABPM in subjects with and without diabetes. CVD risk was consistently greater in patients with than without diabetes for awake SBP/DBP means ≥130/75 mm Hg and asleep means ≥110/65 mm Hg. Derived outcome-based reference thresholds for persons without diabetes were 135/85 mm Hg for the awake and 120/70 mm Hg for the asleep SBP/DBP means. In terms of CVD outcome, the equivalent cutoff threshold values for patients with diabetes were 120/75 mm Hg for the awake and 105/60 mm Hg for the asleep SBP/DBP means.

Here, we examined the impact of recombinant human GH (rhGH) therapy, compared with placebo, on objective sleep quality in a subset of patients from the same cohort., DESIGN: Single-blind, randomized, crossover design study., METHODS: Fourteen patients with untreated GHD of confirmed or likely pituitary origin, aged 22-74 years, participated in the study. Patients with associated hormonal deficiencies were on appropriate replacement therapy. Polygraphic sleep recordings, with bedtimes individually tailored to habitual sleep times, were performed after 4 months on rhGH or placebo., RESULTS: Valid data were obtained in 13 patients. At the end of the rhGH treatment period, patients had a shorter sleep period time than at the end of the placebo period (479±11 vs 431±19 min respectively; P=0.005), primarily due to an earlier wake-up time, and a decrease in the intensity of SWS (delta activity) (559±125 vs 794±219 &mgr;V(2) respectively; P=0.048)., CONCLUSIONS: Four months of rhGH replacement therapy partly reversed sleep disturbances previously observed in untreated patients. The decrease in delta activity associated with rhGH treatment adds further evidence to the hypothesis that the excess of high-intensity SWS observed in untreated pituitary GHD patients is likely to result from overactivity of the hypothalamic GHRH system due to the lack of negative feedback inhibition by GH.",2013,2022-08-24T07:19:47Z,2022-08-24T07:19:47Z,2013-01-01,763,NA,5,168,NA,European journal of endocrinology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00877190,*Brain Waves/de [Drug Effects]; *Cerebral Cortex/de [Drug Effects]; *Human Growth Hormone/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Hypopituitarism/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; Adult; Aged; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Hormone Replacement Therapy; Human Growth Hormone/df [Deficiency]; Human Growth Hormone/pd [Pharmacology]; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polysomnography; Single-Blind Method; Treatment Outcome,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Several studies aimed to test the effects of low-dose aspirin (ASA) in the prevention of preeclampsia concluded that the beneficial effects of such treatment outweigh adverse ones. Such benefits have not been fully corroborated by larger randomized trials usually carried out in low-risk women, testing a dose of 60 mg/d ASA presumably ingested in the morning, and including women randomized as late as at 26-32 wks of gestation. The authors conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, chronotherapy trial on 350 high-risk pregnant women (183 nulliparous), 30.7 ± 5.3 (mean ± SD) yrs of age, and 13.5 ± 1.4 wks of gestation at the time of recruitment. Women were randomly assigned to one of six groups, defined according to treatment (placebo or ASA, 100 mg/d) and time of treatment: upon awakening, 8 h after awakening, or at bedtime. Intervention started at 12-16 wks of gestation and continued until delivery. Blood pressure (BP) was measured by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) for 48-h at baseline, every 4 wks until the 7th month of gestation, every 2 wks thereafter until delivery, and at puerperium. The effects of ASA on ambulatory BP were markedly dependent on administration time: there was no effect on BP, compared with placebo, when ASA was ingested upon awakening, but the BP reduction was highly statistically significant when low-dose ASA was ingested 8 h after awakening and, to a greater extent, at bedtime (p < .001). At puerperium, 6-8 wks after discontinuation of treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in 24-h BP means between the groups of women who ingested ASA at different circadian times. Women ingesting low-dose ASA, compared with placebo, evidenced a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR) of serious adverse outcomes, a composite of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and stillbirth (.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: .22-.56; p < .001). The HR of individual outcome variables, i.e., preeclampsia, preterm delivery, IUGR, and gestational hypertension, were also significantly lower with ASA versus placebo (p always < .041). There were small and nonsignificant differences in outcomes between placebo and low-dose ASA ingested upon awakening. These four groups combined showed highly significant greater event rate of serious adverse outcomes than women ingesting ASA either in the evening or at bedtime (HR: .19, 95% CI: .10-.39; p < .001). There was no increased risk of hemorrhage, either before or after delivery, with low-dose ASA relative to placebo (HR: .57, 95% CI: .25-1.33; p = .194). Results indicate that (i) 100 mg/d ASA should be the recommended minimum dose for prevention of complications in pregnancy; (ii) ingestion of low-dose ASA should start at ⩽16 wks of gestation; and (iii) low-dose ASA ingested at bedtime, but not upon awakening, significantly regulates ambulatory BP and reduces the incidence of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, preterm delivery, and IUGR. ABPM evaluation at the first trimester of pregnancy provides sensitive endpoints for identification of women at high risk for preeclampsia who might benefit most from the cost-effective preventive intervention with timed low-dose ASA.",2013,2022-08-24T07:19:47Z,2022-08-24T07:19:47Z,2013-01-01,260,NA,1-2,30,NA,Chronobiology international,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00878790,"*Aspirin/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/pc [Prevention & Control]; Adult; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory/mt [Methods]; Circadian Rhythm; Double-Blind Method; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Obstetric Labor, Premature; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Pre-Eclampsia/di [Diagnosis]; Pre-Eclampsia/pp [Physiopathology]; Pregnancy; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sleep; Time Factors",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Predictive compensation has been shown to mitigate the magnitude of latency, but little is known about the extent of its effect on simulator sickness., METHOD: A video camera recorded HMD and simulator imagery to accurately measure apparent latency produced at three head movement frequencies. Predictive compensation strategies were manipulated to measure the difference in apparent latency produced by the test bed in various conditions. Similar methodology was employed with human participants to measure simulator sickness experienced by users of this test bed., RESULTS: In Experiment 1, apparent latency increased significantly as head movement frequency increased. Predictive compensation strategies significantly reduced apparent latency present in the test bed. In Experiment 2, predictive compensation significantly reduced the magnitude of simulator sickness., CONCLUSION: Predictive compensation can be effectively implemented to reduce apparent latency, resulting in a lower magnitude of simulator sickness., APPLICATION: Potential applications include HMD use in which head position is tracked and visual imagery is linked to head or body movement, such as in virtual and augmented reality systems, and is thus critical to functionality and performance.",2012,2022-08-24T07:19:47Z,2022-08-24T07:19:47Z,2012-01-01,235,NA,2,54,NA,Human factors,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00895274,"*Head/ph [Physiology]; *Motion Sickness/pp [Physiopathology]; *Movement/ph [Physiology]; Adolescent; Adult; Computer Simulation; Data Display; Female; Head Protective Devices; Humans; Male; Neural Networks, Computer; Task Performance and Analysis; Young Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the treatment of these disturbances has been understudied. The purpose of our study was to develop a manualized behavioral parent training (BPT) program for parents of young children with ASD and sleep disturbances and to test the feasibility, fidelity, and initial efficacy of the treatment in a small randomized controlled trial (RCT)., PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Parents of a sample of 40 young children diagnosed with ASD with an average age of 3.5years were enrolled in our study. Participants were randomized to either the BPT program group or a comparison group who were given nonsleep-related parent education. Each participant was individually administered a 5-session program delivered over the 8-week study. Outcome measures of feasibility, fidelity, and efficacy were collected at weeks 4 and 8 after the baseline time point. Children's sleep was assessed by parent report and objectively by actigraphy., RESULTS: Of the 20 participants in each group, data were available for 15 participants randomized to BPT and 18 participants randomized to the comparison condition. Results supported the feasibility of the manualized parent training program and the comparison program. Treatment fidelity was high for both groups. The BPT program group significantly improved more than the comparison group based on the primary sleep outcome of parent report. There were no objective changes in sleep detected by actigraphy., CONCLUSIONS: Our study is one of few RCTs of a BPT program to specifically target sleep disturbances in a well-characterized sample of young children with ASD and to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

EX comprised cycling for 15 min at 75% peak power, then a 15-min maximal time trial. After each condition, a full laboratory-based sleep study (polysomnography) was performed. Core and skin temperature, heart rate, salivary melatonin, ratings of perceived fatigue, and recovery were measured in each trial., RESULTS: No differences were observed between conditions for any whole night sleep measures, including total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, rapid eye movement onset latency, wake after sleep onset, or proportion of the night spent in different sleep stages. Core temperature in EX and CWI trials was higher than CON, until it decreased below that of EX and CON until bedtime in CWI. After bedtime, core temperature was similar for all conditions throughout the night, except for a 90-min period where it was lower for CWI than EX and CON (3.5-4.5 h postexercise).

However, the mechanisms underlying this improvement remain to be fully elucidated., OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that acetazolamide stabilizes CSA by attenuating the ventilatory sensitivity to CO2, which is increased in patients with heart failure and is thought to be the major mechanism mediating CSA., METHODS: Six consecutive male patients with stable systolic heart failure and CSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 15 episodes/h) were randomized to a double-blind crossover protocol with acetazolamide or placebo received 1 hour before bedtime for six nights with 2 weeks of wash-out. Under both conditions, we measured the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR), arterial blood Pco2, steady-state metabolic CO2 production, overnight attended polysomnography, and also assessed cardiac and pulmonary function., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with placebo, acetazolamide significantly decreased the AHI (65 ± 32 vs. 31 ± 19 events/h, mean ± SD). Acetazolamide increased the HCVR slope by 55% (3.3 ± 1.7 vs. 5.1 ± 2.4 L/min/mm Hg; P = 0.03), an increase that far exceeded the 12% fall in arterial Pco2 (P = 0.02). The acetazolamide-induced change in the balance of these effects (&Dgr;HCVR × Pco2) was inversely associated with the reduction in AHI (r = 0.8; P = 0.045)., CONCLUSIONS: This placebo-controlled study indicates that acetazolamide improves CSA in patients with heart failure despite an increase in the slope of the HCVR. However, because the degree of HCVR elevation inhibits the improvement in unstable breathing, an increased CO2 chemosensitivity may be a key mechanism underlying an incomplete resolution of CSA with acetazolamide.",2014,2022-08-24T07:19:48Z,2022-08-24T07:19:48Z,2014-01-01,80,NA,1,11,NA,Annals of the american thoracic society,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: American Thoracic Society (61 Broadway 4th Floor, New York NY 10006 - 2755, United States)",NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-00978224,"*Acetazolamide/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Cheyne-Stokes Respiration/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Heart Failure/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Sleep Apnea, Central/dt [Drug Therapy]; Aged; Blood Gas Analysis; Carbon Dioxide; Chemoreceptor Cells/ph [Physiology]; Cheyne-Stokes Respiration/bl [Blood]; Cheyne-Stokes Respiration/et [Etiology]; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Heart Failure/bl [Blood]; Heart Failure/co [Complications]; Humans; Hypercapnia/bl [Blood]; Male; Middle Aged; Polysomnography; Respiratory Physiological Phenomena; Sleep Apnea, Central/bl [Blood]; Sleep Apnea, Central/et [Etiology]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our sample consisted of 55 adolescents (mean age, 15.44 y; 85.5% girls) with symptoms of chronic sleep reduction (loss of energy, shortness of sleep, sleepiness, and irritation). Sleep was monitored with actigraphy over 3 weeks; the first week was the baseline week and the last two weeks were the experimental weeks. Participants in the experimental group were instructed to extend their sleep during the week by gradually advancing their bedtimes by 5 minutes each night. Additionally participants were asked to prevent bedtime shifts on weekend nights. Cognitive performance was assessed before and after the experimental manipulation., RESULTS: During the last week of the experiment, adolescents in the sleep extension group had earlier bedtimes, earlier sleep onsets, spent more time in bed, and slept longer than adolescents in the control group.

Nocturnal oxygen therapy (NOT) and acetazolamide improve SDB in patients with PH, and NOT improves exercise capacity. We investigated the effect of NOT and acetazolamide on nocturnal cardiac conduction, repolarization, and arrhythmias in patients with PH and SDB., METHODS: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial, 23 patients with arterial (n = 16) or chronic thromboembolic PH (n = 7) and SDB defined as a mean nocturnal oxygen saturation < 90% or dips (> 3%) > 10/h with daytime Pao2 ≥ 7.3 kPa were studied. Participants received NOT (3 L/min), acetazolamide tablets (2 × 250 mg), and sham-NOT/placebo each during 1 week separated by a 1-week washout period. Three-lead ECG was recorded during overnight polysomnography at the end of each treatment period. Repolarization indices were averaged over three cardiac cycles at late evening and at early morning, and nocturnal arrhythmias were counted., RESULTS: NOT was associated with a lower overnight (68 ± 10 beats/min vs 72 ± 9 beats/min, P = .010) and early morning heart rate compared with placebo. At late evening, the heart rate-adjusted PQ time was increased under acetazolamide compared with placebo (mean difference, 10 milliseconds; 95% CI, 0-20 milliseconds; P = .042). In the morning under NOT, the heart rate-adjusted QT (QTc) interval was decreased compared with placebo (mean difference, -25 milliseconds; 95% CI, -45 to -6 milliseconds; P = .007), and the interval between the peak and the end of the T wave on the ECG was shorter compared with acetazolamide (mean difference, -11 milliseconds; 95% CI, -21 to -1 milliseconds; P = .028).

In the home setting, we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the safety of a system consisting of an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor communicating wirelessly with a bedside computer running an algorithm that temporarily suspends insulin delivery when hypoglycemia is predicted., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: After the run-in phase, a 21-night randomized trial was conducted in which each night was randomly assigned 2:1 to have either the predictive low-glucose suspend (PLGS) system active (intervention night) or inactive (control night). Three predictive algorithm versions were studied sequentially during the study for a total of 252 intervention and 123 control nights. The trial included 19 participants 18-56 years old with type 1 diabetes (hemoglobin A1c level of 6.0-7.7%) who were current users of the MiniMed Paradigm® REAL-Time Revel™ System and Sof-sensor® glucose sensor (Medtronic Diabetes, Northridge, CA)., RESULTS: With the final algorithm, pump suspension occurred on 53% of 77 intervention nights. Mean morning glucose level was 144±48 mg/dL on the 77 intervention nights versus 133±57 mg/dL on the 37 control nights, with morning blood ketones >0.6 mmol/L following one intervention night. Overnight hypoglycemia was lower on intervention than control nights, with at least one value ⩽70 mg/dL occurring on 16% versus 30% of nights, respectively, with the final algorithm., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the PLGS system in the home setting is safe and feasible.

There were positive correlations between the two devices for measures of sleep time, respiratory events, and the AHI (all correlations > 0.89). Bland-Altman analysis of the AHI showed positive agreement between devices, particularly at levels around common diagnostic thresholds. The mean difference in AHI values was 1.4 events per hour, and at a diagnostic threshold of 15 events per hour, sensitivity and specificity were 88% and 91%. More than 93% of PSG defined respiratory events were identified by the Sonomat and the absence of respiratory events was correctly identified in 91% of occasions.

However, interventions to maximize perfusion, such as flat head-of-bed (HOB) positioning, are currently prescribed empirically. Bedside monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) allows the effects of interventions such as flat HOB to be monitored and may ultimately be used to guide clinical management., METHODS: Cerebral perfusion was measured during HOB manipulations in 17 patients with unilateral AIS affecting large cortical territories in the anterior circulation. Simultaneous measurements of frontal CBF and arterial flow velocity were performed with diffuse correlation spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler ultrasound, respectively. Results were analyzed in the context of available clinical data and a previous study., RESULTS: Frontal CBF, averaged over the patient cohort, decreased by 17% (P=0.034) and 15% (P=0.011) in the ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres, respectively, when HOB was changed from flat to 30°. Significant (cohort-averaged) changes in blood velocity were not observed. Individually, varying responses to HOB manipulation were observed, including paradoxical increases in CBF with increasing HOB angle. Clinical features, stroke volume, and distance to the optical probe could not explain this paradoxical response., CONCLUSIONS: A lower HOB angle results in an increase in cortical CBF without a significant change in arterial flow velocity in AIS, but there is variability across patients in this response. Bedside CBF monitoring with diffuse correlation spectroscopy provides a potential means to individualize interventions designed to optimize CBF in AIS.",2014,2022-08-24T07:19:49Z,2022-08-24T07:19:49Z,2014-01-01,1269,NA,5,45,NA,Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01012230,"*Brain Ischemia/pp [Physiopathology]; *Brain/bs [Blood Supply]; *Cerebrovascular Circulation/ph [Physiology]; *Stroke/pp [Physiopathology]; Aged; Blood Flow Velocity/ph [Physiology]; Brain Ischemia/di [Diagnosis]; Brain Ischemia/th [Therapy]; Brain/pp [Physiopathology]; Clinical Protocols; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Stroke/di [Diagnosis]; Stroke/th [Therapy]; Supine Position/ph [Physiology]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To date, studies that investigate the effects of sleep extension on adolescents' sleep and depressive symptoms are still lacking. This study aims to investigate the effects of gradual sleep extension combined with sleep hygiene advice in adolescents with chronic sleep reduction on objectively measured sleep, self-reported sleep problems and depressive symptoms., METHODS: Fifty-five adolescents with chronic sleep reduction (mean age: 15.44 years; 85.5% females) were included in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to either a sleep extension group (gradual sleep extension by advancing bedtimes in the evening and receiving sleep hygiene advice) or to a control group (no instruction). Sleep was measured with actigraphy during three weeks, the first week was the baseline week, and the last two weeks were the experimental weeks during which sleep was extended. Other outcome variables were self-reported sleep problems (daytime sleepiness, symptoms of insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorder) and depressive symptoms, which were assessed before and after the experimental manipulation., RESULTS: During the third week of the experiment, adolescents in the sleep extension group had earlier bedtimes, earlier sleep onsets, spent more time in bed and slept longer than adolescents in the control group. Their chronic sleep reduction, insomnia symptoms and depressive symptoms diminished significantly. In addition, there was a trend of improved circadian rhythm sleep disorder symptoms and sleep quality., CONCLUSION: Gradual sleep extension combined with sleep hygiene advice seems to have beneficial effects on sleep, self-reported sleep problems and depressive symptoms of adolescents with chronic sleep reduction.

Trazodone may increase arousal threshold without compromising upper airway muscles, which should improve OSA., OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine how trazodone alters OSA severity and arousal threshold. We hypothesized that trazodone would increase the arousal threshold and improve the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) in selected patients with OSA., METHODS: Subjects were studied on two separate nights in a randomized crossover design. Fifteen unselected subjects with OSA (AHI ≥ 10/h) underwent a standard polysomnogram plus an epiglottic catheter to measure the arousal threshold. Subjects were studied after receiving trazodone (100 mg) and placebo, with 1 week between conditions. The arousal threshold was calculated as the nadir pressure before electrocortical arousal from approximately 20 spontaneous respiratory events selected randomly., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with placebo, trazodone resulted in a significant reduction in AHI (38.7 vs. 28.5 events/h, P = 0.041), without worsening oxygen saturation or respiratory event duration. Trazodone was not associated with a significant change in the non-REM arousal threshold (-20.3 vs. -19.3 cm H2O, P = 0.51) compared with placebo. In subgroup analysis, responders to trazodone spent less time in N1 sleep (20.1% placebo vs. 9.0% trazodone, P = 0.052) and had an accompanying reduction in arousal index, whereas nonresponders were not observed to have a change in sleep parameters., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that trazodone could be effective therapy for patients with OSA without worsening hypoxemia. Future studies should focus on underlying mechanisms and combination therapies to eliminate OSA.

SR entailed 5 consecutive nights at 4 h TIB; NSR entailed 5 consecutive nights at 8 h TIB. Subjects received three workload test sessions/day consisting of 15-min preworkload assessments, followed by a 60-min (MW) or 120-min (HW) workload manipulation comprised of visually based cognitive tasks, and concluding with 15-min of postworkload assessments. Experimental nights were followed by two 8-h TIB recovery sleep nights. Polysomnography was collected on baseline night 3, experimental nights 1, 4, and 5, and recovery night 1 using three channels (central, frontal, occipital [C3, Fz, O2])., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: High workload, regardless of sleep duration, increased subjective fatigue and sleepiness (all P < 0.05). In contrast, sleep restriction produced cumulative increases in Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) lapses, fatigue, and sleepiness and decreases in PVT response speed and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) sleep onset latencies (all P < 0.05). High workload produced longer sleep onset latencies (P < 0.05, d = 0.63) and less wake after sleep onset (P < 0.05, d = 0.64) than moderate workload. Slow-wave energy-the putative marker of sleep homeostasis-was higher at O2 than C3 only in the HW + SR condition (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: High cognitive workload delayed sleep onset, but it also promoted sleep homeostatic responses by increasing subjective fatigue and sleepiness, and producing a global sleep homeostatic response by reducing wake after sleep onset. When combined with sleep restriction, high workload increased local (occipital) sleep homeostasis, suggesting a use-dependent sleep response to visual work.

Following a week of self-selected sleep duration, adolescents were randomized to a five-night deficient sleep opportunity (6.5 hr in bed) or a healthy sleep opportunity (10 hr in bed) obtained by systematically changing bedtimes. Wake time remained consistent across all 3 weeks (including weekends). Daily reports of sleep patterns and asthma symptoms, actigraphy, and daily peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR), as well as weekly spirometry and exhaled nitric oxide were collected., RESULTS: Participants averaged 3.2 hr less sleep (P < 0.001) per night in the short sleep condition versus the long sleep condition. Further, they had an 8.4% decrease overnight in PEFR (P = 0.007), and reported more asthma symptoms interfering with activities in the past 24 hr (P = 0.02) in the short sleep condition than the long sleep condition. No significant differences between experimental weeks were found for weekly spirometry or exhaled nitric oxide., CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of a cross-over sleep manipulation protocol in adolescents with asthma.

Information on major contributors to nocturnal hypoglycemia remains critical for understanding and mitigating risk. Materials and Methods: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data for 855 nights were studied, generated by 45 subjects 15-45 years of age with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels of <8.0% who participated in a larger randomized study. Factors assessed for potential association with nocturnal hypoglycemia (CGM measurement of <60? mg/dL for >30? min) included bedtime blood glucose (BG), exercise intensity, bedtime snack, insulin on board, day of the week, previous daytime hypoglycemia, age, gender, HbA1c level, diabetes duration, daily basal insulin, and daily insulin dose. Results: Hypoglycemia occurred during 221 of 885 (25%) nights and was more frequent with younger age (P<0.001), lower HbA1c levels (P=0.006), medium/high-intensity exercise during the preceding day (P=0.003), and the occurrence of antecedent daytime hypoglycemia (P=0.001). There was a trend for lower bedtime BG levels to be associated with more frequent nocturnal hypoglycemia (P=0.10). Bedtime snack, before bedtime insulin bolus, weekend versus weekday, gender, and daily basal and bolus insulin were not associated with nocturnal hypoglycemia. Conclusions: Awareness that HbA1c level, exercise, bedtime BG level, and daytime hypoglycemia are all modifiable factors associated with nocturnal hypoglycemia may help patients and providers decrease the risk of hypoglycemia at night.

Subjects were randomized daily to either standard or altered CCU alarm settings. Secondary outcomes included the number of clinically significant events (CSEs) detected, event-triggered interventions (ETIs), frequency of alarms per monitored bed, and patient complications., RESULTS: Over the two-week study time frame, 22 unique patients were enrolled. There were 1,710 alarms over 163 hours of monitoring in the standard group and 1,165 alarms over 169 hours in the study group (P < 0.001).

Compared to restricted sleep opportunity controls, forced awakenings subjects had significantly less slow wave sleep (P < 0.05) after the first night of sleep deprivation, and significantly lower positive mood (P < 0.05) after the second night of sleep deprivation. The differential change in slow wave sleep statistically mediated the observed group differences in positive mood (P = 0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first human experimental study to demonstrate that, despite comparable reductions in total sleep time, partial sleep loss from sleep continuity disruption is more detrimental to positive mood than partial sleep loss from delaying bedtime, even when controlling for concomitant increases in negative mood.

A secondary goal was to replicate previous findings on the effects of SR on dietary intake., DESIGN: Randomized cross-over sleep restriction-extension paradigm., SETTING: Sleep was obtained and monitored at home. Outcome measures were gathered during office visits., PARTICIPANTS: 31 typically-developing adolescents aged 14-17 years., INTERVENTIONS: The three-week protocol consisted of a baseline week, followed randomly by five consecutive nights of SR (6.5 hours in bed) versus healthy sleep duration (HS; 10 hours in bed), a 2-night wash-out period, and a 5-night cross-over., MEASUREMENTS: Sleep was monitored via actigraphy.

Whilst health promotion worldwide has concentrated on avoidance of bedsharing, the indigenous Māori community in New Zealand has reproduced a traditional flax bassinet (wahakura) designed to be used in ways that include bedsharing. To date there has been no assessment of the safety of this traditional sleeping device., METHODS/DESIGN: This two arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 200 mother-baby dyads recruited from Māori communities in areas of high deprivation in the Hawkes Bay, New Zealand. They are randomised to wahakura or bassinet use and investigation includes questionnaires at baseline (pregnancy), when baby is 1, 3, and 6 months, and an overnight video sleep study at 1 month with monitoring of baby temperature and oxygen saturation, and measurement of baby urinary cotinine and maternal salivary oxytocin. Outcome measures are amount of time head covered, amount of time in thermal comfort zone, number of hypoxic events, amount of time in the assigned sleep device, amount of time breastfeeding, number of parental (non-feed related) touching infant events, amount of time in the prone sleep position, the number of behavioural arousals and the amount of time infant is awake overnight. Survey data will compare breastfeeding patterns at 1, 3, and 6 months as well as data on maternal mind-mindedness, maternal wellbeing, attachment to baby, and maternal sleep patterns., DISCUSSION: Indigenous communities require creative SUDI interventions that fit within their prevailing world view. This trial, and its assessment of the safety of a wahakura relative to a standard bassinet, is an important contribution to the range of SUDI prevention research being undertaken worldwide., TRIALS REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12610000993099 Registered 16th November 2010.",2014,2022-08-24T07:19:49Z,2022-08-24T07:19:49Z,2014-01-01,240,NA,NA,14,NA,BMC pediatrics,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Publisher: BioMed Central Ltd.

Fifty-three healthy male volunteers (mean ± SD age = 26.51 ± 4.07 years) underwent a randomized three condition study design. A split sleep condition involving two 5-h sleeping opportunities in 24 h [time in bed (TIB) 0300 h-0800 h and 1500 h-2000 h] was compared to a 10-h consolidated nighttime sleep (TIB 2200 h-0800 h) and 10-h consolidated daytime sleep (TIB 1000 h-2000 h). All participants underwent a baseline period of 10 h of nocturnal time in bed (TIB) followed by a 5-d simulated workweek spent in one of the three conditions. Polysomnography, psychomotor vigilance task, digit-symbol substitution task and subjective state were assessed. During the 5-d simulated workweek, participants in the nighttime sleep condition slept the most (total sleep time per day (TST) 8.4 h ± 13.4 min), followed by the split sleep condition (TST 7.16 h ± 14.2 min) and the daytime sleep condition (TST 6.4 h ± 15.3 min). Subjective sleepiness was highest in the daytime sleep condition and lowest in the nighttime sleep condition. No significant differences in performance were observed between the conditions. Compared to a nighttime consolidated sleep opportunity or split sleep, placement of a consolidated sleep opportunity during the day yielded truncated sleep and increased sleepiness. Further research in real-world situations is warranted to fully assess the efficacy of alternative split sleep schedules for improving safety and productivity.",2014,2022-08-24T07:19:50Z,2022-08-24T07:19:50Z,2014-01-01,1218,NA,10,31,NA,Chronobiology international,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01113778,"*Circadian Rhythm/ph [Physiology]; *Psychomotor Performance/ph [Physiology]; *Sleep/ph [Physiology]; Adult; Arousal/ph [Physiology]; Fatigue/pp [Physiopathology]; Fatigue/px [Psychology]; Humans; Male; Polysomnography; Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm/pp [Physiopathology]; Sleep Disorders, Circadian Rhythm/px [Psychology]; Work Schedule Tolerance/ph [Physiology]; Work Schedule Tolerance/px [Psychology]; Young Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial investigated the effects of late-afternoon caffeine and carbohydrate-electrolyte (CEB) co-ingestion on cycling performance and nocturnal sleep., METHODS: Six male cyclists/triathletes (age 27.5 ± 6.9 years) completed an afternoon training session (TS; cycling 80 min; 65% VO2max) followed by a 5 kJ kg(-1) cycling time trial (TT). Caffeine (split dose 2 × 3 mg kg(-1)) or placebo was administered 1 h prior and 40 min into the TS. A 7.4% CEB (3 ml kg(-1) every 15 min) was administered during the TS, followed 30 min after by a standardised evening meal. Participants retired at their usual bedtime and indices of sleep duration and quality were monitored via polysomnography., DATA: mean ± SD., RESULTS: All participants performed better in the caffeine TT (caffeine 19.7 ± 3.3; placebo 20.5 ± 3.5 min; p = 0.006), while ratings of perceived exertion (caffeine 12.0 ± 0.6; placebo 12.9 ± 0.7; p = 0.004) and heart rate (caffeine 175 ± 6; placebo 167 ± 11 bpm; p = 0.085) were lower in the caffeine TS.

Recently, a sheet-shaped breath detection monitor, the SD-101, has been developed, and several reports have so far demonstrated the screening accuracy of this device. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy and the uncertainty of this device., METHODS: A total of 101 suspected OSAHS patients underwent simultaneous examinations with PSG and the SD-101., RESULTS: There was a statistically significant relationship between the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) by the SD-101 and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) by PSG. At an RDI cutoff of 14 episodes per hour, the sensitivity and specificity to detect an AHI ≥20 episodes per hour were 90.2% and 90.0%, respectively. To reduce the influence of sleep efficiency, the time in bed (TIB) obtained from PSG, instead of the total seep time (TST), was used to calculate the AHI from the PSG data. There was also a statistically significant relationship between the RDI and AHI for the TIB. Moreover, it was suggested that arousal index and TIB were likely associated with false-negative and/or false-positive results., CONCLUSION: Although the present study demonstrated a close relationship between the RDI and the AHI, use of the SD-101 to examine symptomatic OSAHS patients should be performed with a full understanding of its incapability to detect the sleep state, including arousal reaction and the existence of false respiratory events caused by body movements.",2014,2022-08-24T07:19:50Z,2022-08-24T07:19:50Z,2014-01-01,1307,NA,12,53,NA,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01115871,"*Polysomnography/is [Instrumentation]; *Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/di [Diagnosis]; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arousal; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Movement; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/pp [Physiopathology]; Sleep Stages; Uncertainty; Young Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our aim was to experimentally compare the effects of one night of induced infrequent night-wakings (of ∼15 min, each requiring a purposeful response) and sleep restriction on sustained attention and mood in young adults., METHODS: In a within-between subjects counterbalanced design, 61 healthy adults (40 females; aged 20-29 years) underwent home assessments of sustained attention and self-reported mood at two times: after a normal (control) sleep night, and after a night of either sleep restriction (4h in bed) or induced night-wakings (four prolonged awakenings across 8h in bed). Sleep was monitored using actigraphy and sleep diaries. Sustained attention was assessed using an online continuous performance test (OCPT), and mood was reported online using the Profile of Mood States (POMS)., RESULTS: Actigraphic data revealed good compliance with experimental sleep requirements. Induced night-wakings and sleep restriction both resulted in more OCPT omission and commission errors, and in increased depression, fatigue and confusion levels and reduced vigor compared to the normal sleep night.

Patients were randomised, using a computer-generated allocation table, to ingest all their prescribed hypertension medications upon awakening or the entire daily dose of ≥ 1 of them at bedtime. Investigators blinded to the hypertension treatment scheme of the patients assessed the development of new-onset diabetes., RESULTS: During a 5.9-year median follow-up, 171 participants developed type 2 diabetes. Patients of the bedtime, compared with the morning-treatment group, showed: (1) significantly lower asleep BP mean, greater sleep-time relative BP decline and attenuated prevalence of non-dipping at the final evaluation (32% vs 52%, p < 0.001); and (2) significantly lower HR of new-onset diabetes after adjustment for the significant influential characteristics of fasting glucose, waist circumference, asleep systolic BP mean, dipping classification and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (unadjusted HR 0.41 [95% CI 0.29, 0.58]; adjusted HR 0.43 [0.31, 0.61]; event-rate 4.8% vs 12.1% with bedtime and morning treatment, respectively; p < 0.001).

However, there is no empirical evidence for the effects of music videos (MVs) on sleep quality in adults with insomnia as assessed by polysomnography (PSG). In this randomized crossover controlled trial, we compared the effects of a peaceful Buddhist MV intervention to a usual-care control condition before bedtime on subjective and objective sleep quality in middle-aged and older adults with chronic insomnia. The study was conducted in a hospital's sleep laboratory. We randomly assigned 38 subjects, aged 50-75 years, to an MV/usual-care sequence or a usual-care/MV sequence. After pretest data collection, testing was held on two consecutive nights, with subjects participating in one condition each night according to their assigned sequence. Each intervention lasted 30 min. Sleep was assessed using PSG and self-report questionnaires. After controlling for baseline data, sleep-onset latency was significantly shorter by approximately 2 min in the MV condition than in the usual-care condition (p = .002). The MV intervention had no significant effects relative to the usual care on any other sleep parameters assessed by PSG or self-reported sleep quality. These results suggest that an MV intervention may be effective in promoting sleep.

This trial aims to evaluate the effect of a robotic animal on behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in people with dementia living in long-term aged care., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cluster-randomised controlled trial with three treatment groups: PARO (robotic animal), Plush-Toy (non-robotic PARO) or Usual Care (Control). The nursing home sites are Australian Government approved and accredited facilities of 60 or more beds. The sites are located in South-East Queensland, Australia. A sample of 380 adults with a diagnosis of dementia, aged 60 years or older living in one of the participating facilities will be recruited. The intervention consists of three individual 15 min non-facilitated sessions with PARO or Plush-Toy per week, for a period of 10 weeks. The primary outcomes of interest are improvement in agitation, mood states and engagement. Secondary outcomes include sleep duration, step count, change in psychotropic medication use, change in treatment costs, and staff and family perceptions of PARO or Plush-Toy.

As such, lurasidone would be expected to modulate sleep and circadian function but there have been no human studies of the sleep effects of a 5-HT7 antagonist. The purpose of this study was to assess effects of lurasidone on sleep., METHODS: This was a cross-over, polysomnographic study involving 54 healthy volunteers who underwent two treatment periods (order randomized) each consisting of two nights in the laboratory: Night 1-lights out at usual bedtime; Night 2-4-h advance of sleep phase and randomization to either lurasidone 40 mg or placebo. The next morning impairment testing was carried out., RESULTS: Lurasidone significantly (p < 0.05) increased total sleep time by an average of 28.4 min versus placebo, decreased wake time after sleep onset and wake time after the final awakening, and increased sleep efficiency. No other effects were found., CONCLUSIONS: Lurasidone had a sleep maintenance effect without effects on sleep onset, rapid eye movement, or slow-wave sleep. Lurasidone is likely to be beneficial to patients with disturbed sleep, particularly those with sleep maintenance problems.

Methods: A parallel-group design, quasi-laboratory study was conducted in a boarding school. Fifty-five healthy adolescents (25 males, age = 15-19 y) who reported habitual TIBs of approximately 6 h on week nights (group average) but extended their sleep on weekends were randomly assigned to Sleep Restriction (SR) or Control groups. Participants underwent a 2-week protocol comprising 3 baseline nights (TIB = 9 h), 7 nights of sleep opportunity manipulation (TIB = 5 h for the SR and 9 h for the Control group), and 3 nights of recovery sleep (TIB = 9 h). Polysomnography was obtained on two baseline, three manipulation, and two recovery nights. Results: Across the sleep restriction nights, total SWS duration was preserved relative to the 9 h baseline sleep opportunity, while other sleep stages were reduced. Considering only the first 5 h of sleep opportunity, SR participants had reduced N1 duration and wake after sleep onset (WASO), and increased total sleep time (TST), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and slow wave sleep (SWS) relative to baseline. Total REM sleep, N2, and TST duration remained above baseline levels by the third recovery sleep episode. Conclusions: In spite of preservation of SWS duration over multiple nights of sleep restriction, adolescents accustomed to curtailing nocturnal sleep on school day nights evidence residual effects on sleep macro-structure, even after three nights of recovery sleep. Older teenagers may not be as resilient to successive nights of sleep restriction as is commonly believed.",2016,2022-08-24T07:19:51Z,2022-08-24T07:19:51Z,2016-01-01,1233,NA,6,39,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: Associated Professional Sleep Societies,LLC (2510 N.

Optimization of placebo analgesia may contribute to the clinical efficacy and effectiveness of medication for acute and chronic pain management. We know that the placebo effect operates through two main mechanisms, expectations and learning, which is also influenced by sleep. Moreover, a recent study suggested that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is associated with modulation of expectation-mediated placebo analgesia. We examined placebo analgesia following pharmacological REM sleep deprivation and we tested the hypothesis that relief expectations and placebo analgesia would be improved by experimental REM sleep deprivation in healthy volunteers. Following an adaptive night in a sleep laboratory, 26 healthy volunteers underwent classical experimental placebo analgesic conditioning in the evening combined with pharmacological REM sleep deprivation (clonidine: 13 volunteers or inert control pill: 13 volunteers). Medication was administered in a double-blind manner at bedtime, and placebo analgesia was tested in the morning. Results revealed that 1) placebo analgesia improved with REM sleep deprivation; 2) pain relief expectations did not differ between REM sleep deprivation and control groups; and 3) REM sleep moderated the relationship between pain relief expectations and placebo analgesia. These results support the putative role of REM sleep in modulating placebo analgesia. The mechanisms involved in these improvements in placebo analgesia and pain relief following selective REM sleep deprivation should be further investigated.",2015,2022-08-24T07:19:51Z,2022-08-24T07:19:51Z,2015-01-01,e0144992,NA,12,10,NA,PloS one,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Publisher: Public Library of Science,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01168651,"*Analgesia/px [Psychology]; *Sleep Deprivation/px [Psychology]; Adult; Anticipation, Psychological; Blood Pressure; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Pain/px [Psychology]; Placebo Effect; Polysomnography; Psychomotor Performance; Sleep; Young Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Treatment for GT occurred at the mental health care center UvAMinds in Amsterdam, the Netherlands., PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixteen adolescents (mean age = 15.6 y, SD = 1.6 y, 25% males) meeting DSM-IV criteria for insomnia, were randomized to IT, GT, or WL., INTERVENTIONS: CBTI of 6 weekly sessions, consisted of psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, restriction of time in bed, stimulus control, cognitive therapy, and relaxation techniques. GT was conducted in groups of 6 to 8 adolescents, guided by 2 trained sleep therapists. IT was applied through an online guided self-help website with programmed instructions and written feedback from a trained sleep therapist., MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep was measured with actigraphy and sleep logs for 7 consecutive days. Symptoms of insomnia and chronic sleep reduction were measured with questionnaires. Results showed that adolescents in both IT and GT, compared to WL, improved significantly on sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time at post-test, and improvements were maintained at follow-up. Most of these improvements were found in both objective and subjective measures. Furthermore, insomnia complaints and symptoms of chronic sleep reduction also decreased significantly in both treatment conditions compared to WL. Effect sizes for improvements ranged from medium to large. A greater proportion of participants from the treatment conditions showed high end-state functioning and clinically significant improvement after treatment and at follow-up compared to WL., CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first randomized controlled trial that provides evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is effective for the treatment of adolescents with insomnia, with medium to large effect sizes.

The aim of this trial was to test the impact of a new chart incorporating a modified EWS (MEWS) system and a linked training program on nurses' responses to clinical deterioration (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes were: numbers of patients with vital signs recordings in the first eight postoperative hours; number of times each vital sign was recorded; and nurses' knowledge., METHODS/DESIGN: A pragmatic, parallel-group, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial of intervention versus standard care was conducted in three intervention and three control adult surgical wards in an 867-bed public hospital in Cape Town, between March and July 2010; thereafter the MEWS chart was withdrawn. A total of 50 out of 122 nurses in full-time employment participated. From 1,427 case notes, 114 were selected by randomization for assessment. The MEWS chart was implemented in intervention wards. Control wards delivered standard care, without training. Case notes were reviewed two weeks after the trial's completion. Knowledge was assessed in both trial arms by blinded independent marking of written tests before and after training of nurses in intervention wards. Analyses were undertaken with IBM SPSS software on an intention-to-treat basis., RESULTS: Patients in trial arms were similar. Introduction of the MEWS was not associated with statistically significant changes in responses to clinical deterioration (50 of 57 received no assistance versus 55 of 57, odds ratio (OR): 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05 to 1.31), despite improvement in nurses' knowledge in intervention wards. More patients in intervention than control wards had recordings of respiratory rate (27 of 57 versus 2 of 57, OR: 24.75, 95% CI: 5.5 to 111.3) and recordings of all seven parameters (5 of 57 versus 0 of 57 patients, risk estimate: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.2)., CONCLUSIONS: A MEWS chart and training program enhanced recording of respiratory rate and of all parameters, and nurses' knowledge, but not nurses' responses to patients who triggered the MEWS reporting algorithm., TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (identifier: PACTR201309000626545 ) on 9 September 2013.",2015,2022-08-24T07:19:51Z,2022-08-24T07:19:51Z,2015-01-01,103,NA,NA,16,NA,Trials,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Publisher: BioMed Central Ltd.,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01256345,"*Monitoring, Physiologic/nu [Nursing]; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Decision Support Techniques; Education, Nursing, Continuing; Female; Hospital Bed Capacity; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Inservice Training; Intention to Treat Analysis; Male; Medical Records; Middle Aged; Nursing Staff, Hospital/ed [Education]; Odds Ratio; Patients' Rooms; Postoperative Care; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; South Africa; Surgery Department, Hospital; Time Factors; Vital Signs; Young Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

No prior studies have evaluated the potential compounding effects of lying in an inclined position combined with lateral positioning on GER., STUDY: We evaluated a sleep-positioning device (SPD) consisting of an inclined base and body pillow that maintains lateral position while elevating the head/torso. This was a single institution, randomized controlled trial involving 20 healthy volunteers receiving 4 six-hour impedance-pH tests. After placement of reflux probe, subjects returned home, ate standardized meal, and lay down in randomly assigned positions: SPD right-side down (SPD-R), SPD left-side down (SPD-L), standard wedge any position (W), or flat any position (F). A wireless accelerometer documented position during each study. Number of reflux episodes (RE) and esophageal acid exposure (EAE) were calculated over 6 hours., RESULTS: Significantly less EAE occurred during sleeping SPD-L versus sleeping W, SPD-R, and F. The most EAE occurred during sleeping SPD-R despite use of the positioning device. RE were significantly less SPD-L than SPD-R. Patients sleeping SPD-L and SPD-R spent the majority of first 2 hours and greater than half of 6 hours in assigned position.

Twenty-nine participants were randomly assigned to the Dreampad Pillow® ( n = 10), iRest® meditation ( n = 9), and sleep hygiene ( n = 10) groups. In Phase 1, all participants used a 7-day sleep hygiene regimen to reduce poor sleep habits. In Phase 2 (14 days), 10 participants used the Dreampad Pillow® and sleep hygiene, nine used the iRest meditation and sleep hygiene, and 10 continued sleep hygiene only. At intervention-end, the iRest meditation group experienced statistically greater time asleep than both the Dreampad Pillow® ( p < .006, d = 1.87) and sleep hygiene groups ( p < .03, d = 1.80). The Dreampad Pillow® group experienced statistically fewer nighttime awakenings than the iRest® meditation ( p < .04, d = -1.53) and sleep hygiene ( p < .004, d = -1.43) groups.

Sixteen healthy participants (8 females) completed a 4-day inpatient study. Participants were exposed to blue-depleted circadian-sensitive (C-LED) light and a standard fluorescent light (FL, 4100K) of equal illuminance (50lx) for 8h prior to a fixed bedtime on two separate days in a within-subject, randomized, cross-over design. Each light exposure day was preceded by a dim light (<3lx) control at the same time 24h earlier. Compared to the FL condition, control-adjusted melatonin suppression was significantly reduced. Although subjective sleepiness was not different between the two light conditions, auditory reaction times were significantly slower under C-LED conditions compared to FL 30min prior to bedtime. EEG-based correlates of alertness corroborated the reduced alertness under C-LED conditions as shown by significantly increased EEG spectral power in the delta-theta (0.5-8.0Hz) bands under C-LED as compared to FL exposure. There was no significant difference in total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE%), and slow-wave activity (SWA) between the two conditions. Unlike melatonin suppression and alertness, a significant order effect was observed on all three sleep variables, however. Individuals who received C-LED first and then FL had increased TST, SE% and SWA averaged across both nights compared to individuals who received FL first and then C-LED. These data show that the spectral characteristics of light can be fine-tuned to attenuate non-visual responses to light in humans.",2017,2022-08-24T07:19:52Z,2022-08-24T07:19:52Z,2017-01-01,221,NA,NA,177,NA,Physiology & behavior,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Publisher: Elsevier Inc.

Sleep measures included parent-reported sleep diaries and infant actigraphy. Infant stress was measured via morning and afternoon salivary cortisol sampling, and mothers' self-reported mood and stress. Twelve months after intervention, mothers completed assessments of children's emotional and behavioral problems, and mother-child dyads underwent the strange situation procedure to evaluate parent-child attachment., RESULTS: Significant interactions were found for sleep latency (P < .05), number of awakenings (P < .0001), and wake after sleep onset (P = .01), with large decreases in sleep latency for graduated extinction and bedtime fading groups, and large decreases in number of awakenings and wake after sleep onset for the graduated extinction group. Salivary cortisol showed small-to-moderate declines in graduated extinction and bedtime fading groups compared with controls. Mothers' stress showed small-to-moderate decreases for the graduated extinction and bedtime fading conditions over the first month, yet no differences in mood were detected.

No long-term follow-up studies have documented the continued success of lifestyle changes in treatment; oral appliances have an approximate 50% success rate; compliance with continuous positive airway pressure is poor, ranging from 50% to 89%; and the success rate of upper-airway surgery is only 66.4%. Therefore, some OSAHS patients seek alternative treatments. Objectives • The study intended to examine the efficacy of traditional Chinese therapeutic massage (tui na) for patients with OSAHS. Design • The research team designed a prospective study. Setting • The study took place at the outpatient clinic of the sleep center at the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (Kaohsiung, Taiwan), an academic tertiary medical center. Participants • Participants were 31 patients with moderate to severe OSAHS. Intervention • Each participant received a tui na treatment at multiple acupoints 2 ×/wk for 10 wk for approximately 15 min/session. Outcome Measures • At baseline and 3 mo after treatment, participants completed subjective measures, including (1) quality of life using a 36-item, short-form health survey (SF-36); (2) subjective snoring intensity indicated by bed-partners using a 0-10 visual analog scale (VAS); and (3) excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) status, using a Chinese version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (CESS). The research team completed objective measures, including (1) polysomnography, (2) body mass index, and (3) neck circumference. Results • Twenty patients completed the full course of treatment. The apnea/hypopnea index per hour decreased from 43.8 ± 26.9 to 37.8 ± 31.7 after the treatments, with P = .049 (paired t test). The arousal index and rapid eye movement stage of sleep improved significantly. Statistically significant improvements were observed for the SF-36 on the score for the physical component summary, for its subscale for general health, for the mental component summary, and for 2 of its subscales: vitality and mental health. The VAS and the CESS showed that snoring intensity and EDS decreased significantly, respectively. No major complications occurred. Conclusions • Tui na is a feasible and safe treatment for patients with OSAHS. It can improve the quality of life, sleep architecture, snoring intensity, and EDS in patients with moderate-to-severe OSAHS. In the future, a controlled study should be considered to further investigate the effects of tui na for OSAHS.",2017,2022-08-24T07:19:52Z,2022-08-24T07:19:52Z,2017-01-01,16,NA,4,23,NA,Alternative therapies in health and medicine,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01402450,"*Massage/mt [Methods]; *Medicine, Chinese Traditional/mt [Methods]; *Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/th [Therapy]; Anthropometry; Body Mass Index; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Neck; Organ Size; Polysomnography; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive/pp [Physiopathology]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A single night of total sleep deprivation can reduce the capacity to encode new memories. However, it is unclear how sleep restriction during several consecutive nights affects memory encoding. To explore this, we employed a parallel-group design with 59 adolescents randomized into sleep-restricted (SR) and control groups. Both groups were afforded 9 h time in bed (TIB) for 2 baseline nights, followed by 5 consecutive nights of 5 h TIB for the SR group (n = 29) and 9 h TIB for the control group (n = 30). Participants then performed a picture-encoding task. Encoding ability was measured with a recognition test after 3 nights of 9 h TIB recovery sleep for both groups, allowing the assessment of encoding ability without the confounding effects of fatigue at retrieval. Memory was significantly worse in the sleep-restricted group (P = 0.001), and this impairment was not correlated with decline in vigilance.

In each condition, subjects performed six nights of either EXT or HAB at home followed by an assessment of motor performance and neuromuscular function at baseline (D0) and after one night of TSD, i.e., 34-37 h of continuous wakefulness (D1). Maximal voluntary contractions with superimposed femoral nerve electrical and transcranial magnetic stimulations and stimulations on relaxed muscles were investigated before and after submaximal isometric knee extensor exercises performed until task failure., RESULTS: Time to exhaustion was longer in EXT compared with HAB (+3.9% ± 7.7% and +8.1% ± 12.3% at D0 and D1, respectively). Performance at D1 decreased from D0 similarly between conditions (-7.2% ± 5.6% and -3.7% ± 7.3% in HAB and EXT, respectively). At D1, the RPE during exercise was lower in EXT compared with HAB (-7.2% ± 7.5%) with no difference at D0. No difference was observed in voluntary activation between the two conditions., CONCLUSIONS: Six nights of sleep extension improved sustained contraction time to exhaustion, and this result cannot be explained by smaller reductions in voluntary activation, measured by both nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between sleep-dependent consolidation of memory for faces and partial rapid eye movement sleep deprivation, rapid eye movement density, and fast and slow non-rapid eye movement sleep spindles. Fourteen healthy participants spent 1 night each in the laboratory. Prior to bed they completed a virtual reality task in which they interacted with computer-generated characters. Half of the participants (REMD group) underwent a partial rapid eye movement sleep deprivation protocol and half (CTL group) had a normal amount of rapid eye movement sleep. Upon awakening, they completed a face recognition task that contained a mixture of previously encountered faces from the task and new faces. Rapid eye movement density and fast and slow sleep spindles were detected using in-house software. The REMD group performed worse than the CTL group on the face recognition task; however, rapid eye movement duration and rapid eye movement density were not related to task performance. Fast and slow sleep spindles showed differential relationships to task performance, with fast spindles being positively and slow spindles negatively correlated with face recognition. The results support the notion that rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep characteristics play complementary roles in face memory consolidation.

Exposure to blue-wavelength light in particular from these devices may affect sleep by suppressing melatonin and causing neurophysiologic arousal. We aimed to determine if wearing amber-tinted blue light-blocking lenses before bedtime improves sleep in individuals with insomnia. Fourteen individuals (n = 8 females; age ± SD 46.6 ± 11.5 y) with insomnia symptoms wore blue light-blocking amber lenses or clear placebo lenses in lightweight wraparound frames for 2 h immediately preceding bedtime for 7 consecutive nights in a randomized crossover trial (4-wk washout). Ambulatory sleep measures included the Pittsburgh Insomnia Rating Scale (PIRS) completed at the end of each intervention period, and daily post-sleep questionnaire and wrist-actigraphy. PIRS total scores, and Quality of Life, Distress, and Sleep Parameter subscales, were improved in amber vs. clear lenses condition (p-values <0.05). Reported wake-time was significantly delayed, and mean subjective total sleep time (TST), overall quality, and soundness of sleep were significantly higher (p-values <0.05) in amber vs. clear lenses condition over the 7-d intervention period. Actigraphic measures of TST only were significantly higher in amber vs. clear lenses condition (p = 0.035). Wearing amber vs. clear lenses for 2-h preceding bedtime for 1 week improved sleep in individuals with insomnia symptoms.

The habitual sleep phase is usually located between evening decline and morning rise of the circadian rhythm of core body temperature (CBT). However, the thermophysiological mechanisms promoting or disturbing sleep are not yet fully understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a high heat capacity mattress (HHCM) on CBT, skin temperatures and sleep in comparison to a conventional low heat capacity mattress (LHCM). Based on the higher heat capacity of HHCM an increase in conductive body heat loss enhances the nocturnal decline in CBT can be expected. Based on previous findings this may then be accompanied by an increase in slow wave sleep (SWS). The mattresses were studied in a randomized single-blind crossover design in fifteen healthy young men (Age: 26.9±2.1yr, BMI: 22.2±0.4kg/m2) by overnight in laboratory standard video-polysomnography in a temperature stabilized setting. CBT, room temperature, and skin and mattress surface temperatures were continuously recorded in order to get information about inner and outer body heat flow. Additionally, subjective sleep quality was estimated by visual analogue scale. In comparison to LHCM sleep on HHCM exhibited a selective increase in SWS (16%, p<0.05), increased subjective sleep quality and sleep stability [reduced cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) rate; 5.3%, p<0.01]. Additionally, analyses of the sleep stages showed in the second part of the night a significant increase in SWS and a decrease in REMS. In addition, HHCM induced a greater reduction in CBT (maximally by -0.28°C), reduced the increase in proximal skin temperatures on the back (PROBA; maximally by -0.98°C), and delayed the increase in mattress surface temperature (maximal difference LHCM-HHCM: 6.12°C). Thus, the CBT reduction can be explained by an increase in conductive heat loss to the mattress via proximal back skin regions. Regression analysis identified PROBA as the critical variable to predict inner conductive heat transfer from core to shell and SWS. In conclusion, the study expands the previous findings that a steeper nocturnal decline in CBT increases SWS and subjective sleep quality, whereas inner conductive heat transfer could be identified as the crucial thermophysiological variable, and not CBT.",2018,2022-08-24T07:19:53Z,2022-08-24T07:19:53Z,2018-01-01,23,NA,NA,185,NA,Physiology & behavior,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Publisher: Elsevier Inc.

Previous trials have shown that EKG heart rate is available before pulse rate from a pulse oximeter. To date no trial has looked at how the availability of electrocardiogram (EKG) affects clinical interventions in the delivery room., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the availability of an EKG heart rate value and tracing to the clinical team has an effect on physiologic measures and related interventions during the stabilization of preterm infants., DESIGN/METHODS: Forty (40) premature infants enrolled in a neuro-monitoring study (The Neu-Prem Trial: NCT02605733) who had an EKG monitor available were randomized to have the heart rate information from the bedside EKG monitor either displayed or not displayed to the clinical team. Heart rate, oxygen saturation, FiO2 and mean airway pressure from a data acquisition system were recorded every 2 seconds. Results were averaged over 30 seconds and the differences analyzed using two-tailed t-test. Interventions analyzed included time to first change in FiO2, first positive pressure ventilation, first increase in airway pressure, and first intubation., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in time to clinical interventions between the blinded and unblinded group, despite the unblinded group having access to a visible heart rate at 66 +/- 20 compared to 114 +/- 39 seconds for the blinded group (p < .0001). Pulse rate from oximeter was lower than EKG heart rate during the first 2 minutes of life, but this was not significant., CONCLUSION(S): EKG provides an earlier, and more accurate heart rate than pulse rate from an oximeter during stabilization of preterm infants, allowing earlier intervention. All interventions were started earlier in the unblinded EKG group but these numbers were not significant in this small trial. Earlier EKG placement before pulse oximeter placement may affect other interventions, but this needs further study.",2017,2022-08-24T07:19:53Z,2022-08-24T07:19:53Z,2017-01-01,e0187730,NA,11,12,NA,PloS one,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Publisher: Public Library of Science (E-mail: plos@plos.org),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01443100,"*Electrocardiography/mt [Methods]; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Male; Monitoring, Physiologic; Pilot Projects; Resuscitation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fifty-seven adolescents (31 males, age = 15-19 years) were randomly assigned to nap or no nap groups. Participants underwent a 15-day protocol comprising two sleep restriction (5-hour time-in-bed [TIB]) and recovery (9-hour TIB) cycles. The nap group was also provided with a 1-hour nap opportunity at 14:00 following each sleep restriction night. Polysomnography recordings were obtained on nine nights and five nap episodes., Results: Naps reduced homeostatic sleep pressure on sleep restriction nights as evidenced by longer N2 latency and reduced total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency (SE), and slow wave energy. Sleep debt accumulated in both groups, evidenced by increased TST, greater SE, and reduced wake after sleep onset on recovery compared to baseline nights. Changes were greater in the no nap group. Recovery sleep after the first cycle of sleep restriction did not restore sleep architecture to baseline in either group. SE, rapid eye movement (REM), and non-REM sleep increased, and N2 latency was reduced in the second sleep restriction period., Conclusions: Changes in sleep EEG induced by sleep restriction to 5-hour TIB for five nights were not eliminated after two nights of 9-hour recovery sleep.

Twelve men and 6 women (age: 23 ± 4 years, body fat: 18.8 ± 10.1%) participated in 3 randomized crossover sessions: control (habitual bed- and wake-time), 50% PSR with an advanced wake-time and 50% PSR with a delayed bedtime. Outcome variables included sleep architecture (polysomnography), ad libitum EI (validated food menu), appetite sensations (visual analogue scales), satiety quotient (SQ; mm/100 kcal) and food reward (Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire and the relative-reinforcing value (RRV) of preferred food task). Increased fasting and post-standard breakfast appetite ratings were noted following PSR with an advanced wake-time compared to the control and PSR with a delayed bedtime sessions (Fasting hunger ratings: 77 ± 16 vs. 65 ± 18 and 64 ± 16; P = 0.01; Post-meal hunger AUC: 5982 ± 1781 vs. 4508 ± 2136 and 5198 ± 2201; P = 0.03).

No differences in the RRV of preferred food, SQ and ad libitum lunch intake were noted between sessions. These findings suggest that appetite sensations and food reward are increased following PSR with an advanced wake-time, rather than delayed bedtime, vs., CONTROL: However, this did not translate into increased EI during a test meal.

This study assesses the feasibility and emotional impact of a school-night sleep manipulation protocol to test the effects of lengthening sleep in habitually short-sleeping adolescents., Methods: High school students aged 14-18 years who habitually slept 5-7 hours on school nights participated in a 5-week experimental sleep manipulation protocol. Participants completed a baseline week followed in randomized counterbalanced order by two experimental conditions lasting 2 weeks each: prescribed habitual sleep (HAB; sleep time set to match baseline) and sleep extension (EXT; 1.5-hour increase in time in bed from HAB). All sleep was obtained at home, monitored with actigraphy. Data on adherence, protocol acceptability, mood and behavior were collected at the end of each condition., Results: Seventy-six adolescents enrolled in the study, with 54 retained through all 5 weeks. Compared to HAB, during EXT, participants averaged an additional 72.6 minutes/night of sleep (p < .001) and had reduced symptoms of sleepiness, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion (p < .05). The large majority of parents (98%) and adolescents (100%) said they would ""maybe"" or ""definitely"" recommend the study to another family., Conclusions: An experimental, school-night sleep manipulation protocol can be feasibly implemented which directly tests the potential protective effects of lengthening sleep.

The efficacy of naps to recover from chronic sleep loss is less well understood., Methods: Following 2 baseline nights (10 hours' time-in-bed), participants were restricted to 7 nights of 5-hour sleep opportunity. Ten adults participated in the No-Nap condition, and a further 9 were assigned to a Nap condition with a daily 45-minute nap opportunity at 1300 h. Sleepiness was assessed using the multiple sleep latency test and a visual analogue scale at 2-hour intervals. Both objective and subjective indexes of sleepiness were normalized within subject as a difference from those at baseline prior to sleep restriction. Mixed-effects models examined how the daytime nap opportunity altered sleepiness across the day and across the protocol., Results: Short daytime naps attenuated sleepiness due to chronic sleep restriction for up to 6-8 hours after the nap. Benefits of the nap did not extend late into evening. Subjective sleepiness demonstrated a similar short-lived benefit that emerged later in the day when objective sleepiness already returned to pre-nap levels. Neither measure showed a benefit of the nap the following morning after the subsequent restriction night., Conclusions: These data indicate a short daytime nap may attenuate sleepiness in chronic sleep restriction, yet subjective and objective benefits emerge at different time scales.

The participants (N = 13) were healthy adults (20-40 years of age) with a normal sleeping pattern. The participants underwent a baseline sleep period consisting of five nights with 8 hr spent in bed. A subsequent period with PSD consisted of five nights of maximum 4 hr of sleep per night. Four participants were also subjected to a prolonged period of PSD consisting of eight nights with 4 hr of sleep per night.

The purpose of this study was to determine the short-term efficacy and safety of clonazepam for the treatment of probable RBD (pRBD) in patients with PD., METHODS: We conducted a four-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of clonazepam (0.5mg/day at bedtime) compared to a placebo for RBD symptoms in patients with PD. Patients aged 30years or older who had a caregiver that could observe RBD symptoms were recruited between April 2015 and February 2016. The primary outcome was the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGII) score at week four, and we compared scores between the clonazepam and placebo groups., RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled, with 20 assigned to receive clonazepam and 20 to receive the placebo. The CGI-I score at four weeks indicated an improvement in RBD symptoms in both the clonazepam (median score [minimum, maximum]=2 [1,5]) and placebo (3 [1,6]) groups, with no significant difference between the groups (p=.253). The secondary outcomes were not significantly different between the clonazepam and placebo groups., CONCLUSIONS: Both clonazepam and placebo tended toward improvement on pRBD symptoms in patients with PD.

This study investigated whether four months of moderate-intensity exercise impacted night-to-night variability in sleep among older women. Methods: Participants (n = 49) were randomized to one of two moderate-intensity walking programs with different doses of energy expenditure: low-dose (n = 23: 8 kcal/kg of body weight per week) or high-dose (n = 26: 14 kcal/kg of body weight per week). Sleep parameters were assessed objectively via actigraphy at baseline, mid- (2 months), and postintervention (4 months). Nightly variability in each of the sleep parameters was calculated using the seven-day standard deviation (SD) and a coefficient of variation (SD/mean x 100%). Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak) was measured at baseline and postintervention using a graded treadmill test. Results: Both measures of nightly variability demonstrated a borderline to significantly lower amount of night-to-night variability in wake time after sleep onset (WASO) and number of awakenings at postintervention in comparison to baseline (p ⩽ 0.05). Higher VO2peak levels at baseline were associated with less time in bed and lower total sleep time variability throughout the exercise intervention (p < 0.05).

Hypervolemia has been linked to sleep problems observed in chronic haemodialysis patients, which suggests that optimising one's fluid status could improve the sleep quality of this patient group. In our study, we subjectively examined and objectively measured sleep parameters, using actigraphy recordings, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), in order to compare bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-guided and standard clinical-guided dry weight adjustment. Methods: We randomly selected 19 chronic haemodialysis patients with subclinical hypervolemia, defined as a clinically euvolemic status, despite the ratio of extracellular water to total body water being more than 0.4 in BIA. Furthermore, these patients, who were poor sleepers (PSQI > 5), were assigned to either a BIA-guided dry weight group (BIA group) or a standard clinical-guided one (clinical group). The primary outcome was changes in sleep actigraphy parameters between the groups at 1, 3, and 6 months. Changes observed in the PSQI and ESS score between the two groups over the same period of time were the secondary endpoints. Results: The mean age of the participants was 63.53 Â± 11.12 years, and 42% of them were male. All sleep parameters measured by means of actigraphy were not significantly different between the two groups. Interestingly, at 3 and 6 months, the subjective sleep quality significantly improved in the BIA group, as reflected by a greater decline in the PSQI score, in comparison with the clinical group (3 months: mean difference - 1.82 [- 3.13 to - 0.51], P = 0.006; 6 months: mean difference - 3.16 [- 4.49 to - 1.83], P < 0.001). However, sleepiness assessed by the ESS was not significantly different between the groups throughout the study. Conclusions: Optimisation of the fluid status by employing BIA did not improves sleep actigraphy parameter, however, it significantly ameliorates the subjective sleep quality of chronic haemodialysis patients. This observation should be further explored in larger samples and longer clinical trials.

In the present study, we evaluated the side-effect profile of an orexin receptor antagonist and Î3-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor agonist on physical/cognitive functions upon forced awakening. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was conducted on 30 healthy male subjects. Fifteen minutes before bedtime, the subjects took a pill of suvorexant (20 mg), brotizolam (0.25 mg), or placebo and were forced awake 90 min thereafter. Physical- and cognitive-function tests were performed before taking the pill, after forced awakening, and the next morning. Polysomnographic recordings revealed that the efficacies of the hypnotic agents in prolonging total sleep time (âˆ¼30 min) and increasing sleep efficiency (âˆ¼6%) were comparable. When the subjects were allowed to go back to sleep after the forced awakening, the sleep latency was shorter under the influence of hypnotic agents (âˆ¼2 min) compared to the placebo trial (24 min), and the rapid eye movement latency was significantly shorter under suvorexant (98.8, 81.7, and 48.8 min for placebo, brotizolam, and suvorexant, respectively). Although brotizolam significantly impaired the overall physical/cognitive performance (sum of z score) compared with placebo upon forced awakening, there was no significant difference in the total z score of performance between suvorexant and placebo. Notably, the score for static balance with the eyes open was higher under suvorexant compared to brotizolam administration. The energy expenditure was lower under suvorexant and brotizolam compared with the placebo. The effect size of brotizolam (d = 0.24) to reduce the energy expenditure was larger than that of suvorexant (d < 0.01).",2019,2022-08-24T07:19:54Z,2022-08-24T07:19:54Z,2019-01-01,24353,NA,48,116,NA,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Publisher: National Academy of Sciences,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-02008751,*Azepines/pd [Pharmacology]; *GABA-A Receptor Agonists/pd [Pharmacology]; *Orexin Receptor Antagonists/pd [Pharmacology]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; *Triazoles/pd [Pharmacology]; Adult; Cognition/de [Drug Effects]; Double-Blind Method; Energy Metabolism/de [Drug Effects]; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Hypnotics and Sedatives/pd [Pharmacology]; Male; Polysomnography; Wakefulness/ph [Physiology]; Young Adult,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Objective: To compare treatment with the orexin receptor antagonist lemborexant with placebo and zolpidem tartrate extended release in participants with insomnia disorder. Design, Setting, and Participants: The Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Lemborexant in Subjects 55 Years and Older With Insomnia Disorder (SUNRISE 1) clinical trial was a global randomized double-blind parallel-group placebo-controlled active-comparator phase 3 study conducted at 67 sites in North America and Europe from May 31, 2016, to January 30, 2018. Data analyses were conducted from January 31, 2018, to September 10, 2018. Participants were 55 years and older with insomnia disorder characterized by reported sleep maintenance difficulties and confirmed by sleep history, sleep diary, and polysomnography. Participants could have also had sleep onset difficulties. Interventions: Participants received placebo, zolpidem tartrate extended release (6.25 mg), or lemborexant (5 mg or 10 mg) for 1 month at bedtime. Main Outcomes and Measures: Paired polysomnograms were collected at baseline, the first 2 nights, and the last 2 nights of treatment. The primary end point was the change from baseline in latency to persistent sleep for lemborexant therapy vs placebo. Key secondary end points were changes from baseline in sleep efficiency and wake-after-sleep onset compared with placebo, and wake-after-sleep onset in the second half of the night compared with zolpidem therapy. Results: Among 1006 participants randomized (placebo, n = 208; zolpidem, n = 263; lemborexant 5 mg, n = 266; and lemborexant 10 mg, n = 269), 869 (86.4%) were women and the median age was 63 years (range, 55-88 years).

Also, for nights 29 and 30, wake-after-sleep onset in the second half of the night (least squares mean treatment difference vs zolpidem for lemborexant 5 mg, -6.7 min; 95% CI, -11.2 to -2.2 min; P =.004 and for lemborexant 10 mg, -8.0 min; 95% CI, -12.5 to -3.5 min; P <.001) was significantly greater for both doses of lemborexant therapy compared with zolpidem therapy measured using polysomnography. Six participants (4 in the zolpidem group and 2 in the lemborexant 5 mg group) reported serious adverse events; none were treatment-related. Other adverse events were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, lemborexant therapy significantly improved both sleep onset and sleep maintenance, including in the second half of the night, compared with both placebo and zolpidem measured objectively using polysomnography.

This discovery has ushered in an exciting era of research and brought new hope for patients with MDD. However, the mechanisms underlying the specific antidepressant actions of ketamine in humans remain to be elucidated. Objectives: This study protocol was designed to test the main hypothesis that ketamine could rapidly reverse depression- and stress-associated synaptic loss and deficits in resting-state functional connectivity and that this action could be affected by circadian rhythm, in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Methods/Study Design: In this clinical study, adults (aged 18â“65Â years) with treatment-resistant depression will be randomized to intravenous administration of placebo (control group) or ketamine (0.5Â mg/kg body weight) at 11Â a.m. (daytime group), or 6Â p.m. (nighttime group) for 24Â weeks. The primary outcome will be the change from baseline to 24Â weeks in the total Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score. Brain imaging, sleep, and genetic studies, including functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, polysomnography, and genetic analyses, will be performed to examine whether and how ketamine can rapidly reverse deficits in synaptic function and to identify objective markers for the assessment of ketamine infusion therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Conclusions: This clinical study protocol is the first, to our knowledge, to describe the prospective testing of the hypothesis that daytime and nighttime administrations of ketamine would have different antidepressant effects. The brain imaging, sleep, and genetic findings from patients with treatment-resistant depression are expected to shed new light on the mechanisms of ketamine and its interaction with target sites in the brain, which can be used for objective evaluation of the efficacy of ketamine.",2019,2022-08-24T07:19:55Z,2022-08-24T07:19:55Z,2019-01-01,e01423,NA,11,9,NA,Brain and behavior,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Publisher: John Wiley and Sons Ltd,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-02093037,"*Brain/dg [Diagnostic Imaging]; *Depressive Disorder, Major/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Ketamine/ad [Administration & Dosage]; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Brain/me [Metabolism]; Brain/pp [Physiopathology]; Circadian Rhythm; Depressive Disorder, Major/dg [Diagnostic Imaging]; Depressive Disorder, Major/me [Metabolism]; Depressive Disorder, Major/pp [Physiopathology]; Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/dg [Diagnostic Imaging]; Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/me [Metabolism]; Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant/pp [Physiopathology]; Drug Chronotherapy; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Homeostasis; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Ketamine/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Polysomnography; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prospective Studies; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Synapses; Time Factors; Young Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study investigated whether shortened sleep duration is causally linked to affective functioning in adolescents with ADHD. METHODS: Participants were 48 adolescents (75% male) aged 14-17Â years with ADHD who successfully completed a three-week sleep protocol using an experimental crossover design. The protocol included a phase stabilization week, followed, in randomized counterbalanced order, by one week of sleep restriction (6.5Â hr in bed) and one week of sleep extension (9.5Â hr in bed). Sleep was monitored with objective actigraphy, and all participants included in this study obtained â‰¥1Â hr actigraphy-measured sleep duration during extension compared to restriction. Parents and adolescents provided daily ratings of positive and negative affect during the extension and restriction conditions. Ratings of affect, internalizing symptoms, and emotion regulation were collected at laboratory visits conducted at the end of each week. RESULTS: Both parents and adolescents reported greater depressive symptoms and lower positive affect during restriction compared to extension. Parents also reported greater negative affect and emotion dysregulation among adolescents during sleep restriction than extension. No effects were found for parent- or adolescent-reported anxiety symptoms or for adolescent-reported emotion regulation or negative affect.

METHODS: Participants were randomized into an oral group (oral zolpidem 10 mg and sublingual placebo at bedtime and ""as-needed"") and a sublingual group (oral placebo and sublingual zolpidem 5 mg at bedtime and ""as-needed""). Participants underwent medical evaluation, polysomnography, the psychomotor vigilance test, and completed questionnaires. RESULTS: Of 85 patients, 67 met the criteria for insomnia (48Â±10 years; 79% women) and were randomized. Of these, 46 completed 92Â±5 days of treatment. Mild-to-moderate adverse events were reported by 25% of the participants, including headache, sleepiness, and dizziness. Both treatments decreased middle-of-the-night awakenings by an average of -3.1Â±2.3 days/week and increased total sleep time by 1.5 hours. Changes in sleep quality and insomnia severity scores were also favorable and comparable between groups: variation depended on continuation of treatment. Regarding PSG findings, sleep latency decreased more in the sublingual group than the oral group (-14Â±42 vs. 10Â±29 min; p = 0.03). The psychomotor vigilance test showed minor residual effects 30 minutes after awakening, which reversed after 2 hours.

Data suggest that pharmacologic augmentation of central serotonergic/adrenergic tone increases pharyngeal muscle tone., RESEARCH QUESTION: We hypothesized that venlafaxine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, would improve OSA severity., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this mechanistic, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, 20 patients with OSA underwent two overnight polysomnograms ≥ 4 days apart, receiving either 50 mg of immediate-release venlafaxine or placebo before bedtime. Primary outcomes were the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and peripheral oxygen saturation (Spo2) nadir, and secondary outcomes included sleep parameters and pathophysiologic traits with a view toward understanding the impact of venlafaxine on mechanisms underlying OSA., RESULTS: Overall, there was no significant difference between venlafaxine and placebo regarding AHI (mean reduction, -5.6 events/h [95% CI, -12.0 to 0.9]; P = .09) or Spo2 nadir (median increase, +1.0% [-0.5 to 5]; P = .11). Venlafaxine reduced total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, while increasing non-REM stage 1 sleep (Pall < .05). On the basis of exploratory post hoc analyses venlafaxine decreased (""improved"") the ventilatory response to arousal (-30%; P = .049) and lowered (""worsened"") the predicted arousal threshold (-13%; [P = .02]; ie, more arousable), with no effects on other pathophysiologic traits (Pall ≥ .3). Post hoc analyses further suggested effect modification by arousal threshold (P = .002): AHI improved by 19% in patients with a high arousal threshold (-10.9 events/h [-3.9 to -17.9]) but tended to increase in patients with a low arousal threshold (+7 events/h [-2.0 to 16]). Other predictors of response were elevated AHI and less collapsible upper airway anatomy at baseline (, r, > 0.5, P ⩽ .02)., INTERPRETATION: In unselected patients, venlafaxine simultaneously worsened and improved various pathophysiologic traits, resulting in a zero net effect.

METHODS: Sixteen men and women, (age: 22.3â‰Â±â‰1.4Â years; BMI: 20.8â‰Â±â‰1.4Â kg/m2, intermediate chronotype) took part in three randomized crossover sessions spread over three consecutive weeks: control session (CTL), 1Â h exercise session at 6:30Â pm (E6:30) and 1Â h exercise session at 8:30Â pm (E8:30), in which exercise finished 4Â h and 2Â h before habitual bedtime, respectively. Exercise was an outdoor run at 60% HRmaxth. Energy expenditure and sleep were ambulatories monitored by accelerometry under free-living condition. Ad-libitum dinner and breakfast were used to measure subsequent energy intake and proportion of that energy derived from each macronutrient. RESULTS: Evening exercise did not disrupt sleep. Improvement in sleep quality compared to the control condition was observed only when exercise was performed 4Â h before habitual bedtime (WASO: pâ‰<â‰0.01; SE: pâ‰<â‰0.02). Interestingly, our results give insight into differences in sleep parameters response to evening exercise between habitually poor and good sleepers mainly when it comes to sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset (all pâ‰<â‰0.01). There was no difference in calorie intake from ad-libitum dinner and breakfast.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of head-of-bed elevation by using the wedge-shaped pillow (WSP) on the reflux symptoms of patients with esophageal cancer following esophagectomy and reconstruction. METHODS: Fourteen patients with nocturnal reflux symptoms following esophagectomy and gastric tube reconstruction were enrolled and randomized into 2 groups. A 2-week crossover trial was performed using 2 sequences (drug only and drug plus WSP). The WSP was designed with a height of 20 cm, a length of 62 cm, and an elevation angle of 20 degrees and used with fabricated from memory foam. After 2 weeks, all of the patients received combined drug and WSP intervention for 3 months. Reflux symptoms were measured by Dysfunction After Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery for Cancer and examined by endoscopic observations prior to intervention and follow-up for 3 months. RESULT: The average reflux symptom score for the combined drug and WSP treatment in the beginning 2 weeks was lower than that for the drug-only sequence. The severity of esophagitis was improved in 46.1%, and 38.5% showed a stabilization after 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Combined drug and WSP treatment may be beneficial in improving GE reflux symptoms.

Dunal.) is long known for its sleep-inducing effects. Ashwagandha can be proposed as an alternative to the recommended present treatments for insomnia. This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacological effect of Ashwagandha root extract on sleep in healthy subjects and also in the subjects having insomnia. Material and methods: We performed a randomized, parallel-group, stratified design, placebo-controlled study. A total of 80 eligible participants, 40 in Arm-A (healthy) and 40 in Arm-B (insomnia) were assigned to two groups, either Ashwagandha or placebo and studied for 8-weeks. The assessment was done based on the sleep parameters (Sleep Onset Latency, Total Sleep Time, Wake After Sleep Onset, Total time in bed, and Sleep Efficiency), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Hamilton Anxiety scale-A questionnaire, mental alertness on rising assessment, and sleep quality questionnaire. Safety and adverse events along with the concomitant medication were also assessed. Results: In both healthy and insomnia subjects, there was a significant improvement in the sleep parameters in the Ashwagandha root extract supplemented group. The improvement was found more significant in insomnia subjects than healthy subjects. Repeat measure Analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed the significant improvement in SOL (p 0.013), HAM-A outcomes (p < 0.05), mental alertness (p 0.01), and sleep quality (p < 0.05) of the insomnia patients. A two-way ANOVA was used to confirm the outcomes that denoted sleep onset latency (p < 0.0001) and sleep efficiency (p < 0.0001) as the most improved parameters, followed by TST (p < 0.002) and WASO(p < 0.040). All these parameters (SOL, TST, WASO, TIB, SE, PSQI, HAM-A, Mental Alertness, and Sleep quality) were also statistically assessed for the significant improvement within the group both for the treatment, and the placebo groups in the healthy and the insomnia datasets. Obtained results suggest statistically significant (p < 0.0001) changes between the baseline values and the end of the study results except for the HAM-A and the mental alertness scoresn the healthy subject group.

Methods/Procedures This was a double-blind, randomized, 3-period, crossover, phase 1 study. Balance and psychomotor performance were evaluated during the night in 12 healthy elderly participants after bedtime administration of suvorexant 30 mg (a supratherapeutic dose), the GABAergic agonist zolpidem 5 mg (the recommended dose in the elderly), or placebo. Balance (body sway measured by platform stability) and psychomotor performance (measured by choice reaction time) were assessed predose and at 1.5, 4, and 8 hours postdose in each period. Memory (measured by word recall) was assessed predose and at 4 hours postdose. Findings/Results At 1.5 hours after nighttime administration of each drug (the approximate time of their anticipated maximal plasma concentrations), both zolpidem and suvorexant increased body sway versus placebo, with a greater increase for zolpidem than suvorexant. Suvorexant increased choice reaction time compared with placebo or zolpidem at 1.5 hours. There were no treatment differences on body sway or choice reaction time at 4 or 8 hours, or on word recall at 4 hours. Implications/Conclusions These exploratory data suggest that a 30-mg dose of suvorexant (supratherapeutic) and a 5-mg dose of zolpidem (recommended dose in the elderly) impaired balance at 1.5 hours in healthy elderly people, with potentially less impairment for suvorexant relative to zolpidem, but no treatment differences on body sway or psychomotor performance at 4 and 8 hours.

We studied 20 infants, with a history of breath-holding spells and a median age of 12 wk (range 4-46 wk). During sleep they had a median of 6 airway obstructions per 10-hr recording (range 3-16 events), with a median duration of 8 sec (range 4-12 sec). No explanation was found for the airway obstructions. In every infant, a double-blind crossover challenge was conducted. It included oral administration of tincture of belladonna, equivalent to 0.01 mg/kg weight of atropine, and placebo syrup containing no belladonna. The belladonna, or the placebo, was administered at bedtime for 7 days, followed by a 7-day washout period. Another 7-day series of syrup administration was then undertaken. A nighttime polygraphic recording was made after each 7-day series. It was the belladonna, and not the placebo, that induced the disappearance of the obstructions in 10 infants; these were called ""drug responsive"". In 5 children no effect was observed after either the placebo or belladonna; these infants were defined as ""drug unresponsive"". In 4 subjects the obstructions disappeared after both belladonna and the placebo; the children were considered to have an ""inconclusive response"". One infant was excluded from the study because he developed an airway infection. It is concluded that in some breath-holding infants, obstructed breathing episodes during sleep disappear after the administration of an atropinic drug.

Following their assigned time in bed conditions, subjects were counterbalanced to have a standard MSLT and a 24-hour enforced bedtime protocol. To assess the effect of TIB on the MSLT, the sleep latencies were submitted to a four (TIB condition) by four (nap test) multivariate analysis of variance. The sleep latencies were shorter for those subjects in the 0-hours condition when compared to the other three conditions.

The study design was a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Patients were evaluated during a polysomnographic study after each 2 weeks of treatment. Breathing sounds were recorded with two microphones symmetrically placed on each side of the bed, the signal being preamplified, equalized, and analyzed by using a real time analyzer. A snoring event was defined as a breathing sound with a sound pressure level (SPL) greater than 60 dB SPL. The snoring index (number/sleep hour) and the sound intensity of each event were automatically determined. Mild side effects were observed in ten subjects, but no subject interrupted the study because of them. The REM sleep time decreased with protriptyline with a parallel increase in stages 1 to 2. There was no difference in body position during sleep between the placebo and protriptyline trials. The snoring index decreased from 335 +/- 40 with placebo to 238 +/- 41 with protriptyline (p < 0.05) with important individual differences. Among the different sleep stages, the highest values of the snoring index were observed in slow-wave sleep with placebo. The snoring index decreased in each sleep stage with protriptyline, the highest decrease occurring in slow-wave sleep. The percentage of total sleep time (TST) spent above 60 dB SPL was significantly lower with protriptyline (6.1 +/- 1.2 percent TST) than with placebo (8.6 +/- 1.2 percent TST). Changes in snoring characteristics were not correlated with snoring severity, the drug blood level, the body mass index, or the drug-induced modifications in sleep architecture.

The MMSE and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) were used to assess for changes in cognitive function., RESULTS: Sixty-two subjects were randomized and provided data for circadian, daytime and nighttime parameters (placebo, n = 12; lemborexant 2.5 mg [LEM2.5], n = 12; lemborexant 5 mg [LEM5], n = 13, lemborexant 10 mg [LEM10], n = 13 and lemborexant 15 mg [LEM15], n = 12). Mean L5 showed a decrease from baseline to week 4 for LEM2.5, LEM5 and LEM15 that was significantly greater than with placebo (all p < 0.05), suggesting a reduction in restlessness. For RA, LS mean change from baseline to week 4 versus placebo indicated greater distinction between night and day with all dose levels of lemborexant, with significant improvements seen with LEM5 and LEM15 compared with placebo (both p < 0.05). The median percentage change from baseline to week 4 in MDSB during the daytime indicated a numerical decrease in duration for LEM5, LEM10 and LEM15, which was significantly different from placebo for LEM5 and LEM15 (p < 0.01 and p = 0.002, respectively). There were no serious treatment-emergent adverse events or worsening of cognitive function, as assessed by the MMSE and ADAS-Cog. Lemborexant was well tolerated. No subjects discontinued treatment., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence of the potential utility of lemborexant as a treatment to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms in patients with ISWRD and AD-D.",2021,2022-08-24T07:19:56Z,2022-08-24T07:19:56Z,2021-01-01,7,NA,1,8,NA,The journal of prevention of alzheimer's disease,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-02340679,"*Alzheimer Disease/co [Complications]; *Circadian Rhythm/de [Drug Effects]; *Orexin Receptor Antagonists/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Pyridines/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Pyrimidines/ad [Administration & Dosage]; *Sleep Wake Disorders/dt [Drug Therapy]; Actigraphy/mt [Methods]; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Orexin Receptor Antagonists/pd [Pharmacology]; Pyridines/pd [Pharmacology]; Pyrimidines/pd [Pharmacology]; Sleep Wake Disorders/et [Etiology]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of the present study was to assess sleep patterns, sleep behavior and prevalence of insomnia in pregnant women in the third trimester, by comparing them to a group of non-pregnant women. Further, how perceived stress and evening light exposure were linked to sleep characteristics among the pregnant women were examined., METHODS: A total of 61 healthy nulliparous pregnant women in beginning of the third trimester (recruited from 2017 to 2019), and 69 non-pregnant women (recruited in 2018) were included. Sleep was monitored by actigraphy, sleep diaries and the Bergen Insomnia Scale. The stress scales used were the Relationship Satisfaction Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale and the Pre-Sleep Arousal Scale. Total white light exposure three hours prior to bedtime were also assessed., RESULTS: The prevalence of insomnia among the pregnant women was 38%, with a mean score on the Bergen Insomnia Scale of 11.2 (SD = 7.5). The corresponding figures in the comparing group was 51% and 12.3 (SD = 7.7). The pregnant women reported lower sleep efficiency (mean difference 3.8; 95% CI = 0.3, 7.3), longer total sleep time derived from actigraphy (mean difference 59.0 minutes; 95% CI = 23.8, 94.2) and higher exposure to evening light (mean difference 0.7; 95% CI = 0.3, 1.2), compared to the non-pregnant group. The evening light exposure was inversely associated with total sleep time derived from actigraphy (B = -8.1; 95% CI = -14.7, -1.5), and an earlier midpoint of sleep (B = -10.3, 95% CI = -14.7, -5.9). Perceived stressors were unrelated to self-reported and actigraphy assessed sleep., CONCLUSION: In healthy pregnant participants sleep in the third trimester was preserved quite well.

The ideal purpose of ingestion-time (chronopharmacology, i.e. biological rhythm-dependent effects on the kinetics and dynamics of medications, and chronotherapy, i.e. the timing of pharmaceutical and other treatments to optimize efficacy and safety) trials should be to explore the potential impact of endogenous circadian rhythms on the effects of medications. Such investigations and outcome trials mandate adherence to the basic standards of human chronobiology research. In-depth review of the more than 150 human hypertension pharmacology and therapeutic trials published since 1974 that address the differential impact of upon-waking/morning versus at-bedtime/evening schedule of treatment reveals diverse protocols of sometimes suboptimal or defective design and conduct. Many have been ""time-of-day,"" i.e. morning versus evening, rather than circadian-time-based, and some relied on wake-time office BP rather than around-the-clock ambulatory BP measurements (ABPM). Additionally, most past studies have been of too small sample size and thus statistically underpowered. As of yet, there has been no consensual agreement on the proper design, methods and conduct of such trials. This Position Statement recommends ingestion-time hypertension trials to follow minimum guidelines: (i) Recruitment of participants should be restricted to hypertensive individuals diagnosed according to ABPM diagnostic thresholds and of a comparable activity/sleep routine. (ii) Tested treatment-times should be selected according to internal biological time, expressed by the awakening and bed times of the sleep/wake cycle. (iii) ABPM should be the primary or sole method of BP assessment. (iv) The minimum-required features for analysis of the ABPM-determined 24 h BP pattern ought to be the asleep (not ""nighttime"") BP mean and sleep-time relative BP decline, calculated in reference to the activity/rest cycle per individual. (v) ABPM-obtained BP means should be derived by the so-called adjusted calculation procedure, not by inaccurate arithmetic averages. (vi) ABPM should be performed with validated and calibrated devices at least hourly throughout two or more consecutive 24 h periods (48 h in total) to achieve the highest reproducibility of mean wake-time, sleep-time and 48 h BP values plus the reliable classification of dipping status. (vii) Calculation of minimum required sample size in adherence with proper statistical methods must be provided. (viii) Hypertension chronopharmacology and chronotherapy trials should preferably be randomized double-blind, randomized open-label with blinded-endpoint, or crossover in design, the latter with sufficient washout period between tested treatment-time regimens.",2021,2022-08-24T07:19:56Z,2022-08-24T07:19:56Z,2021-01-01,1,NA,1,38,NA,Chronobiology international,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-02296442,"Antihypertensive Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Chronotherapy; Circadian Rhythm; Eating; Humans; Hypertension/dt [Drug Therapy]; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Time Factors",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Water polo athletes (n = 26) attending a 7-night training camp (study 1) and triathletes (n = 23) attending a 4-night training camp (study 2) were randomly allocated to a no-device group (no electronic devices could be used after dinner or overnight; ND) or control group (unrestricted electronic device use; CON). Sleep was monitored through wrist actigraphy. The ND group completed a questionnaire measuring anxiety related to being unable to use electronic devices (""nomophobia""). Triathletes also completed a psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) at the start and end of camp. Water polo ND athletes went to bed earlier and spent longer time in bed than CON on the first night, but not on other nights. In triathletes, sleep quantity was not different between groups on any night. No statistically significant differences were observed for changes in nomophobia from the first to the last night of camp.

Although there are published therapeutic guidelines for the administration of melatonin for DSWPD, to our knowledge, randomised controlled trials are lacking. This trial tested the efficacy of 0.5 mg melatonin, combined with behavioural sleep-wake scheduling, for improving sleep initiation in clinically diagnosed DSWPD patients with a delayed endogenous melatonin rhythm relative to patient-desired (or -required) bedtime (DBT)., METHODS: This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was conducted in an Australian outpatient DSWPD population. Following 1-wk baseline, clinically diagnosed DSWPD patients with delayed melatonin rhythm relative to DBT (salivary dim light melatonin onset [DLMO] after or within 30 min before DBT) were randomised to 4-wk treatment with 0.5 mg fast-release melatonin or placebo 1 h before DBT for at least 5 consecutive nights per week. All patients received behavioural sleep-wake scheduling, consisting of bedtime scheduled at DBT. The primary outcome was actigraphic sleep onset time. Secondary outcomes were sleep efficiency in the first third of time in bed (SE T1) on treatment nights, subjective sleep-related daytime impairment (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS]), PROMIS sleep disturbance, measures of daytime sleepiness, clinician-rated change in illness severity, and DLMO time., FINDINGS: Between September 13, 2012 and September 1, 2014, 307 participants were registered; 116 were randomised to treatment (intention-to-treat n = 116; n = 62 males; mean age, 29.0 y). Relative to baseline and compared to placebo, sleep onset occurred 34 min earlier (95% confidence interval [CI] -60 to -8) in the melatonin group. SE T1 increased; PROMIS sleep-related impairment, PROMIS sleep disturbance, insomnia severity, and functional disability decreased; and a greater proportion of patients showed more than minimal clinician-rated improvement following melatonin treatment (52.8%) compared to placebo (24.0%) (P < 0.05). The groups did not differ in the number of nights treatment was taken per protocol. Post-treatment DLMO assessed in a subset of patients (n = 43) was not significantly different between groups. Adverse events included light-headedness, daytime sleepiness, and decreased libido, although rates were similar between treatment groups. The clinical benefits or safety of melatonin with long-term treatment were not assessed, and it remains unknown whether the same treatment regime would benefit patients experiencing DSWPD sleep symptomology without a delay in the endogenous melatonin rhythm., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, melatonin treatment 1 h prior to DBT combined with behavioural sleep-wake scheduling was efficacious for improving objective and subjective measures of sleep disturbances and sleep-related impairments in DSWPD patients with delayed circadian phase relative to DBT. Improvements were achieved largely through the sleep-promoting effects of melatonin, combined with behavioural sleep-wake scheduling., TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12612000425897.",2018,2022-08-24T07:19:57Z,2022-08-24T07:19:57Z,2018-01-01,e1002587,NA,6,15,NA,PLoS medicine,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01708123,"*Melatonin/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Sleep Aids, Pharmaceutical/tu [Therapeutic Use]; *Sleep Wake Disorders/dt [Drug Therapy]; *Sleep/de [Drug Effects]; Actigraphy; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New South Wales; South Australia; Victoria; Young Adult",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We assessed how different apportionment of restricted sleep (continuous vs. split sleep) influences neurobehavioral function and glucose levels., METHODS: Adolescents, aged 15-19 years, were evaluated in a dormitory setting using a parallel-group design. Following two baseline nights of 9-hour time-in-bed (TIB), participants underwent either 5 nights of continuous 6.5-h TIB (n = 29) or 5-hour nocturnal TIB with a 1.5-hour afternoon nap (n = 29). After two recovery nights of 9-hour TIB, participants were sleep restricted for another three nights. Sleep was assessed using polysomnography (PSG). Cognitive performance and mood were evaluated three times per day. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were conducted on mornings after baseline sleep, recovery sleep, and the third day of each sleep restriction cycle., RESULTS: The split sleep group had fewer vigilance lapses, better working memory and executive function, faster processing speed, lower level of subjective sleepiness, and more positive mood, even though PSG-verified total sleep time was less than the continuous sleep group. However, vigilance in both sleep-restricted groups was inferior to adolescents in a prior sample given 9-hour nocturnal TIB. During both cycles of sleep restriction, blood glucose during the OGTT increased by a greater amount in the split sleep schedule compared with persons receiving 6.5-hour continuous sleep., CONCLUSIONS: In adolescents, modest multinight sleep restriction had divergent negative effects on cognitive performance and glucose levels depending on how the restricted sleep was apportioned.

Objective assessments included snoring variables, breathing route during sleep, and polysomnography measures compared with baseline. Nasal breathing, congestion, and sleep were measured subjectively using rating scales and questionnaires. During a crossover nasal resistance phase (n=55), nasal resistance was measured using posterior rhinomanometry with the strip applied on one of two nights., RESULTS: In the active phase, breathing and sleep were perceived to improve, with less daytime sleepiness (P<0.04) and increased ease of breathing, sleep quality, staying asleep, and feeling refreshed in the morning (all P <0.0001). However, while objective polysomnography metrics were generally similar with and without the strip, median wake after sleep onset time was numerically reduced by~11 min, and the spontaneous arousal rate fell by~37%. In the nasal resistance phase (n=55), median resistance (at 0.2-0.25 l/s) while asleep was 39.1% lower with (n=37) versus without (n=36) the strip (1.34 vs. 2.20 cmH2O/l/s; P=0.048)., CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study supports a role for the improved spring force nasal dilator strip in alleviating sleep-related symptoms in subjects with chronic nasal congestion, potentially via lowering nasal resistance and reducing nocturnal awakenings.

One such manifestation of this disturbance is the circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Irregular Sleep- Wake Rhythm Disorder (ISWRD). There are currently no treatments approved for ISWRD. The controlled treatment period of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept and dose-finding clinical trial has been completed, which included endpoints related to the effect of lemborexant on nighttime sleep, daytime wakefulness, circadian rhythm parameters, and other clinical measures of ISWRD in patients with mild to moderate AD-D. Methods: Subjects 60 to 90 years who met criteria for both AD and ISWRD were recruited from sites in the United States, Japan and the UK. Eligible subjects had Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores between 10 and 26 and were not clinically depressed. Patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea were excluded based on polysomnography. Subjects wore actigraphy devices (MotionWatch 8, CamNtech; MW8) continuously on the non-dominant wrist for approximately 14 days, and were eligible for randomization after meeting criteria indicating both disrupted nighttime sleep and daytime wakefulness. Subjects were randomized to placebo or to 1 of 4 treatment arms of lemborexant (2.5, 5, 10, or 15 mg), and provided instructions to take the study medication before the time the subject intended to try to sleep. Efficacy variables were derived from the actigraphy data at screening, baseline, and over 1 month of treatment, and included but were not limited to actigraphy-based sleep and wake efficiency, sleep and wake fragmentation indices, duration of sleep bouts during the day and wake bouts at night, timing and activity within the least 5 active hours, relative amplitude, intradaily variability, and interdaily stability. In addition, scored epochs (30 sec) from each patient were obtained for further analysis. The raw actigraphs from each patient for each data was available and utilized for functional analysis as well. To assist in the analysis of data, informants maintained a log each day of the study to indicate when the subjects went to bed for the night and when they got out of bed in the morning as well as times when the actigraph was not recording data e.g. if the device had been removed for some reason. Following the 4-week treatment period, there was a 2-week follow-up period without study medication to assess for possible rebound ISWRD symptoms (using actigraphy) and for safety. Results: Since ISWRD is a relatively new therapeutic area, there is limited knowledge about the utility of numerous efficacy measures obtained from the patients' actigraphy data for evaluating efficacy. To this end, Multivariate Network Analysis of key efficacy variables related to circadian rhythms was conducted to identify the primary variables impacted by treatment, as well as inter-relationships among them. Special methods were used, since the number of variables was large compared to the small sample size of 61 randomized subjects. In particular, machine learning methods were applied to perform variable selection, assuming a sparse multivariate network topology. The algorithm selected a few night-time and day-time efficacy variables for each patient. The selected variables were compared across treatment groups in univariate regression models. In addition, functional data analysis summary measures were obtained using a novel algorithm to process the patients' actigraphy data. Differences between treatment groups using these functional measures were evaluated as well. The key findings were that lemborexant 5 mg showed benefit over placebo between baseline and week 4 of treatment as follows, (a) larger decrease in average duration of sleep bouts during the day; (b) larger decrease in average activity during the least active 5 hours of the day; (c) earlier onset of the least 5 hours of activity of the day (but still during the night); and (d) larger decrease in the average number of wake bouts at night. The actigraph functional analysis showed that lemborexant 5mg was associated with a higher increase in amplitude (1/2 peak to nadir difference) and circadian quotient (ratio of amplitude and mesor (the average activity over the 24-hr period) when compared with placebo from baseline to week 4 of treatment. Conclusions: This randomized clinical trial provides important new information regarding the potential utility of this investigational medication to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms that impact the quality of life of ISWRD/AD-D patients and their caregivers and families through the use of novel analytic methodology.",2019,2022-08-24T07:19:57Z,2022-08-24T07:19:57Z,2019-01-01,S46,NA,NA,6,NA,Journal of prevention of alzheimer's disease,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Publisher: Springer,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-02130543,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

After a clinical/adaptation polysomnographic (PSG) night, sixteen women with insomnia symptoms had two random-order PSG nights: immersive audio-visual respiratory bio-feedback across the falling asleep period (manipulation night), and no pre-sleep arousal manipulation (control night). While using immersive audio-visual respiratory bio-feedback, overall heart rate variability was increased and heart rate (HR) was reduced (by~5 bpm; p<0.01), reflecting downregulation of autonomic pre-sleep arousal, relative to no-manipulation. HR continued to be lower during sleep, and participants had fewer awakenings and sleep stage transitions on the manipulation night relative to the control night (p<0.05).

However, findings are mixed on the relationship between sleep and physical activity (PA) during the school year, when short sleep duration is most common. Furthermore, there is concern that increasing sleep duration may interfere with opportunities for PA, yet this has not been directly tested. This study examined the impact of an at-home experimental sleep extension protocol on PA during the school year among short-sleeping adolescents., PARTICIPANTS/METHODS: Participants included 18 adolescents (67% female, 78% white) who reported regularly sleeping between 5-7 h on school nights. Adolescents completed a five-week, at-home sleep manipulation protocol with an initial baseline week followed in a randomized, counterbalanced order by two experimental conditions, each lasting two weeks. During prescribed habitual sleep (HAB), bedtimes and rise times were set to match the baseline sleep pattern, and during sleep extension (EXT), adolescents were instructed to increase time in bed on school nights by 1.5 h per night relative to baseline. Wrist-mounted actigraphy was employed to monitor sleep and waist-mounted accelerometers were used to measure daytime PA., RESULTS: Adolescents slept for an average duration of 71 min longer on school nights during EXT than during HAB (p < 0.001). During HAB, adolescents spent more time in sedentary behavior (p = 0.002) than during EXT, but there were no cross-condition differences in light activity (p = 0.184) or moderate-to-vigorous PA (p = 0.102)., CONCLUSIONS: Extending sleep duration on school nights in short-sleeping adolescents reduces time spent in sedentary behavior, without having a negative impact on health-promoting moderate-to-vigorous PA.",2018,2022-08-24T07:19:57Z,2022-08-24T07:19:57Z,2018-01-01,7,NA,NA,47,NA,Sleep medicine,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-02000502,*Exercise/ph [Physiology]; *Sleep Deprivation/co [Complications]; Accelerometry/mt [Methods]; Actigraphy/mt [Methods]; Adolescent; Female; Humans; Male; Obesity/et [Etiology]; Obesity/pc [Prevention & Control]; Sedentary Behavior; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Paradoxically, athletes often encounter difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, while having sufficient sleep opportunity. Blue (short-wavelength) light as emitted by electronic screens is considered a potential sleep thief, as it suppresses habitual melatonin secretion. The current study sought to investigate whether blocking short-wavelength light in the evening can improve sleep onset latency and potentially other sleep parameters among recreational athletes. The study had a within-subject crossover design. Fifteen recreational athletes, aged between 18 and 32 years (12 females, 3 males), were randomly assigned to start the intervention period with either the light restriction condition (LR; amber-lens glasses), or the no-light restriction condition (nLR; transparent glasses). Sleep hygiene practices, actigraphy and diary-based sleep estimates were monitored during four consecutive nights within each condition. Sleep hygiene practices did not significantly differ between conditions. Results indicate that blocking short-wavelength light in the evening, as compared to habitual light exposure, significantly shortened subjective sleep onset latency (DELTA=7 min), improved sleep quality (DELTA=0.6; scale 1-10), and increased alertness the following morning. Actigraphy-based sleep estimates showed no significant differences between conditions. Blocking short-wavelength light in the evening by means of amber-lens glasses is a cost-efficient and promising means to improve subjective sleep estimates among recreational athletes in their habitual home environment. The relatively small effects of the current study may be strengthened by additionally increasing morning- and daytime light exposure and, potentially, by reducing the alerting effects of media use before bedtime.",2019,2022-08-24T07:19:58Z,2022-08-24T07:19:58Z,2019-01-01,728,NA,6,19,NA,European journal of sport science,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01991042,*Sleep/re [Radiation Effects]; Actigraphy; Adolescent; Adult; Athletes; Cross-Over Studies; Eyeglasses; Female; Humans; Light; Male; Pilot Projects; Young Adult,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many studies of acute manipulation of wake duration have confirmed the precise homeostatic regulation of SWA in rodents and humans. However, some chronic sleep restriction studies in rodents show that the sleep homeostatic response, as indexed by SWA, is absent or diminishes suggesting adaptation occurs. Here, we investigate the response to 7 days of sleep restriction (6 hr time in bed) and extension (10 hr time in bed) as well as the response to subsequent total sleep deprivation in 35 healthy participants in a cross-over design. The homeostatic response was quantified by analyzing sleep structure and SWA measures. Sleep restriction resulted primarily in a reduction of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. SWA and accumulated SWA (slow-wave energy, SWE) were not much affected by sleep extension/restriction. The SWA responses did not diminish significantly in the course of the intervention and did not deviate significantly from the predictions of the two-process model. The response to total sleep deprivation consisted of an increase in SWA and rise rate of SWA and SWE and did not differ between the two conditions. The data show that changes in sleep duration within an ecologically relevant range have a marked effect on REM sleep and that SWA responds in accordance with predictions based on a saturating exponential increase during wake and an exponential decline in sleep of homeostatic sleep pressure during both chronic sleep restriction and extension.",2018,2022-08-24T07:19:58Z,2022-08-24T07:19:58Z,2018-01-01,NA,NA,7,41,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=cctr&NEWS=N&AN=CN-01913628,"*Adaptation, Physiological/ph [Physiology]; *Brain Waves/ph [Physiology]; *Sleep Deprivation/pp [Physiopathology]; *Sleep, REM/ph [Physiology]; Adult; Cross-Over Studies; Electroencephalography; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Homeostasis; Humans; Male; Polysomnography; Sleep/ph [Physiology]",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To increase the airway space posterior to the tongue base without severely affecting the craniomandibular joint, the mHA was adjusted to anchor the mandible at 50% of maximum protrusion. MR producing an occlusal coverage but no protrusion served as a control appliance. All-night static charge-sensitive bed (SCSB) and finger oximeter recordings were done to six male patients in three conditions: first without dental device and then with mHA and with MR, in a random order, after a 2 month period of habituation. The oxyhaemoglobin desaturation events were 44.7 h-1 of recording observed during the control night, 29.6 h-1 with mHA (P = 0.087). The frequency of body movements decreased from 34.9 to 20.4 h-1 (P = 0.0079), respectively.

We conclude that 50% protrusion chosen for these experiments, produced with a mHA, brought about some alleviation of upper airway obstruction in our preselected patients, but did not lead to sufficient control of apnoea.

When mothers hold or cuddle their infants they create a microenvironment with stimuli similar to those of the intrauterine environment. Several of these same stimuli were incorporated into a cradle designed to provide a similar ""holding"" environment for the infant when the mother was not there. Ninety healthy term newborn infants were randomized to an experimental (n = 45) or control group (n = 45). The experimental group used a cradle that produced motion, sound, tactile (containment), and reduced-light stimuli at stimulus levels that initially approximated intrauterine sensory stimulation levels and gradually decreased to the levels of the home environment over 16 weeks. The control group used an identical cradle with no stimulus modulation features. Infants were placed in their respective cradles from 2 hours after birth during the times they would normally be placed in an infant bed. The mother-infant interaction or parenting style was not changed or manipulated. Mothers' use of the cradles did not differ significantly. An electronic status monitor measured and recorded infant presence and crying in the cradles.

However, despite the widespread agreement of the need for regular repositioning (typically every two hours), adherence to repositioning schedules remains poor in the clinical environment and there are some indications that the situation in home environment is even worse. Our team has recently developed a non-contact system that can continuously determine an individual's position in bed (left-side lying, right-side lying or supine) using data from a set of inexpensive load cells placed under the bed frame. A proof of principle study showed that our system was able to detect whether healthy participants were supine, left-side lying or right-side lying with 94.2% accuracy in the lab environment. The objective of the present work was to deploy our system into the home environment to evaluate how well the system was able to detect the position of individuals sleeping in their own beds overnight by comparing to ground truth time-lapse camera images using eight machine learning classifiers. Nine participants were recruited for this study and we found our system was able to detect an individual's position in bed with 98.1% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.982 using the XGBoost classifier. Future work will include using this system to evaluate interventions focused on improving adherence to 2-hour repositioning schedules for pressure injury prevention or management as well as incorporating this technology in a repositioning prompting system to alert caregiver when a patient has remained in the same position for too long.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

A key best practice to prevent and treat pressure injuries is to minimize prolonged tissue deformation by ensuring at-risk individuals are repositioned regularly (typically every 2 hours). However, adherence to repositioning is poor in clinical settings and expected to be even worse in homecare settings. Our team has designed a position detection system for home use that uses machine learning approaches to predict a patient's position in bed using data from load cells under the bed legs. The system predicts the patient's position as one of three position categories: left-side lying, right-side lying, or supine. The objectives of this project were to: i) determine if measuring ground truth patient position with an inertial measurement unit can improve our system accuracy (predicting left-side lying, right-side lying, or supine) ii) to determine the range of transverse pelvis angles (TPA) that fully offloaded each of the great trochanters and sacrum and iii) evaluate the potential benefit of being able to predict the individual's position with higher precision (classifying position into more than three categories) by taking into account a potential drop in prediction accuracy as well as the range of TPA for which the greater trochanters and sacrum were fully offloaded. Data from 18 participants was combined with previous data sets to train and evaluate classifiers to predict the participants' TPA using four different position bin sizes (~70degree, 45degree, ~30degree, and 15degree) and the effects of increasing precision on performance, where patients are left side-lying at -90degree, right side-lying at 90degree and supine at 0degree). A leave-one-participant-out cross validation approach was used to select the best performing classifier, which was found to have an accuracy of 84.03% with an F1 score of 0.8399. Skin-bed interface forces were measured using force sensitive resistors placed on the greater trochanters and sacrum. Complete offloading for the sacrum was only achieved for the positions with TPA angles <-90degree or >90degree, indicating there was no benefit to predicting with greater precision than with three categories: left, right, and supine.Copyright The copyright holder for this preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Method(s): Eight glioma patients had 4-11 GammaTile placed along the resection bed after maximal safe resection during craniotomy. Each GammaTile composed of four Cs-131 seeds imbedded in a biodegradable collagen sponge to minimize seed movement and maintain seed to cavity surface distance. Cs-131 seed positions were identified using VariSeed on day1 and day30 post-implant CT images and dosimetry parameters were calculated. Iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm was used to compute rigid transformation between day1 and day30 seeds clouds. Seeds displacement was calculated after registration. Volume covered by 100% isodose line (V100), PTV coverage (D90-PTV, V100-PTV) and dose to OARs were calculated for both CT datasets to determine dosimetric changes due to seed displacement. Result(s): Average seed displacement of 1.9+/-1.0 mm for all patients was observed between day1 and day30. Maximum seed displacement for each patient ranges from 2.3mm to 7.3mm. Average V100 difference between day1 and day30 was 2.7cc (range: 0.5cc - 6.5cc). Average D90-PTV are 100.5% (range: 70.0% - 131.0%) and 95.7% (range: 19.9% - 149.0%) on day1 and d30, respectively. Average V100-PTV are 89.6% (81.3% - 99.1%) and 87% (range: 47.0% - 99.7%) on day1 and d30, respectively. Our results showed that brainstem dose changed from 63.5Gy (day1) to 55.8Gy (day30) for one patient and from 52.0Gy to 45.3Gy for another patient. Meanwhile, optic nerve dose changed from 34.1Gy to 35.9Gy for one patient. Conclusion(s): We observed up to 7.3mm maximum seed displacement and 6.5cc V100 volume change due to seed displacement caused by cavity shrinkage. Cavity shrinkage also affected PTV coverage due to change in PTV volume/shape and seed displacement.

We recently developed a computer vision and artificial intelligence-driven frameless stereotaxy for nonimmobilized patients, creating an opportunity to develop accurate and rapidly deployable robots for bedside cranial intervention. OBJECTIVE(S): To validate a portable stereotactic surgical robot capable of frameless registration, real-time tracking, and accurate bedside catheter placement. METHOD(S): Four human cadavers were used to evaluate the robot's ability to maintain low surface registration and targeting error for 72 intracranial targets during head motion, ie, without rigid cranial fixation. Twenty-four intracranial catheters were placed robotically at predetermined targets. Placement accuracy was verified by computed tomography imaging. RESULT(S): Robotic tracking of the moving cadaver heads occurred with a program runtime of 0.111 +/- 0.013 seconds, and the movement command latency was only 0.002 +/- 0.003 seconds. For surface error tracking, the robot sustained a 0.588 +/- 0.105 mm registration accuracy during dynamic head motions (velocity of 6.647 +/- 2.360 cm/s). For the 24 robotic-assisted intracranial catheter placements, the target registration error was 0.848 +/- 0.590 mm, providing a user error of 0.339 +/- 0.179 mm. CONCLUSION(S): Robotic-assisted stereotactic procedures on mobile subjects were feasible with this robot and computer vision image guidance technology. Frameless robotic neurosurgery potentiates surgery on nonimmobilized and awake patients both in the operating room and at the bedside. It can affect the field through improving the safety and ability to perform procedures such as ventriculostomy, stereo electroencephalography, biopsy, and potentially other novel procedures. If we envision catheter misplacement as a ""never event,"" robotics can facilitate that reality.Copyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2022.

PPG is simple, non-invasive, and commonly used in sleep diagnostic devices to reflect oxygen saturation (SpO2). Current research has addressed other PPG features that may provide information on autonomic, cardiac, and vascular function. Material(s) and Method(s): This study describes the development of a web solution using HTML/Flask as a GUI (graphical user interface) and a Python backend for practical extraction of PPG-derived parameters. The Python backend computes several parameters including pulse wave amplitude (PWA), peak-to-peak interval (PPI), pulse propagation time (PPT), and the augmentation index (AIX) from a raw PPG signal in European data format (EDF). The raw PPG signals can be exported from most available recording devices. The web interface enables the user to run the algorithm on an entire cohort of recordings or to perform an in-depth analysis of the PPG waveform in specific time frames of one recoding. Result(s): A prototype of the algorithm allowed extraction of relevant pulse wave features, displaying summary reports, as well as exporting these features. A first proof-of-concept trial used the prototype to analyze PPG waveform signals from 10 ambulatory polysomnography recordings (A1 system, Nox Medical, Iceland) from subjects with suspected sleep apnea. On average, 30018 artifact-free pulse waves were extracted from 6-10 hours of sleep recordings. Feature extraction for PWA, PPI, PPT, AIX was successful in all recordings (4 hours and more for each subject). Conclusion(s): This work describes the first prototype of a web-based, cross-platform PPG analysis tool. In the current version, it computes several features of the PPG-derived finger pulse wave on top of the information provided by oxygen saturation and pulse rate. The new technology allows easily accessible visualization and relevant summary statistics. Future developments include extraction of additional PPG features and calibration of a cardiovascular risk algorithm based on the newly proposed SCORE risk matrix.Copyright © 2022",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:06Z,2022-08-24T07:29:06Z,NA,S290,NA,Supplement 1,100,NA,Sleep Med.,NA,16th World Sleep Congress.

For example, as measured via actigraphy, crawling infants woke more frequently during the night than age-matched controls who had not yet begun to crawl (Scher, 2005). Intensive longitudinal analysis of prospective parent diaries showed that the first day infants performed a motor skill, as well as the day they demonstrated mastery, predicted increased night wakings and shorter sleep durations (Berger & Moore, 2021). These traditional methods of collecting sleep and motor data are too intrusive, costly, and/or effortful to feasibly collect data on a large scale. However, because infant sleep is so variable from night-to-night, large-scale data collection is necessary to describe periods of stable sleep and identify deviations from stability. Thus, the aim of this study was to test whether auto-videosomnography, which has been shown to be as accurate as actigraphy for documenting infants' sleep characteristics (Horger, et al., 2021), could efficiently capture the relation between infants' sleep and motor development. Material(s) and Method(s): 1302 parents of infants between the ages of 9 and 14 months completed the Survey of Well-being of Young Children (SWYC) on-line. The SWYC is a 40-question screening instrument for children under 5 years old that includes cognitive, language, motor and social-emotional subscales. All participants were users of Nanit, a commercial, home video baby monitoring system that video-records infants in their cribs. A sophisticated machine learning algorithm uses computer vision technology to calculate and report sleep characteristics including nightly wake episodes. For the purposes of this abstract, only data from the motor subscale and from families who reported their infant's walking experience (not yet, somewhat, very much; n=279) are reported. Result(s): A 6 (age; 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 mos) x 3 (experience) ANOVA on the number of night wakings revealed a significant main effect of walk experience, F(5, 261)=4.05, p=.02. Across ages, but especially for younger infants, those whose parents reported that they walk very much woke more frequently than those with less experience. Conclusion(s): These findings replicate previous work on the onset of crawling and pulling-to-stand showing that infants' sleep was most disrupted for those who achieved their motor milestones earlier than average (Atun-Einy & Scher, 2016; Scher & Cohen, 2015) and extends it to the new milestone context of walking. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using auto-videosomnography to study the relation between sleep and motor development in infancy. Thus, this new method has the potential to collect data more efficiently and on a larger scale than has been done to date. This creates opportunities for researchers to track individual developmental trajectories and, in turn, the power to predict change rather than just document it.

Poor sleep hygiene is related to a variety of ill-health effects, including metabolism dysregulation, cardiovascular problems, memory and attention problems and poor academic performance. However, research on sleep practices mostly focuses on the consequences of poor sleep behavior, and seldom addresses its determinants. The purpose of this study was to test if the constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) predicted unhealthy sleep behaviors of Belgian university students. Material(s) and Method(s): An online questionnaire was used to assess the frequency of irregular sleep times, daytime napping, alcohol use before sleep, and engaging in activities that keep awake such as being on the internet or video watching before bedtime, as well as the attitudes, perceived norms, perceived control and intentions towards these behaviors, amongst 1006 university students enrolled at a French-speaking university (70% females). The sample was also divided according to the type of study (i.e. humanities, health sciences or sciences and technology), the year of study (i.e. bachelor level, master level or other such as PhD students or complementary master students) and type of residence (i.e. living with parents, shared housing, studio apartment or other). Principal Component analysis (PCA) and internal consistency analysis (Cronbach alpha) was used to establish the validity and reliability of the scales representing the dimensions of the TCP for each behavior. Result(s): Multiple regression analyses showed that perceived advantages and disadvantages, perceived norms and perceived control significantly predicted 21% of the intention to avoid irregular sleep patterns, 74% of the intention to take daytime naps, 27% of the intention to engage in activities that keep awake, and 45% of the intention to consume alcohol before bedtime. Intentions and perceived behavioral significantly predicted self-reported irregular sleeping times (R2=.15), daytime napping (R2=.36), performing activities keeping awake before bedtime (R2=.23), and alcohol use before bedtime (R2=.51). Multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant for the four sleep hygiene behaviors with regard to gender, study type and type of residence. Conclusion(s): The TPB dimensions provide a useful framework to predict healthy sleep intentions and behaviors of university students. Their role can be take into account when developing healthy sleep promotion campaigns for students. Moreover, results from the multivariate analysis providing alternative perspectives for new interventions.

The objective was to measure sleep-wake patterns and to conduct exploratory genetic analyses to delineate the genetic landscape of the DSWPD phenotype. Material(s) and Method(s): We measured the sleep-wake patterns (self-reported bed time, wake time, midpoint of sleep, and sleep latency) of participants by daily post-sleep diaries for 10 weeks. Participants completed questionnaires on demographics, medical and surgical history, sleep history, and concomitant medications. Altogether, 119 participants were consented and 76 participants provided samples for whole genome sequencing. Seventy-eight participants were females and the mean age was 44 years. Principal component analysis defined ancestry as 29.3% AFR, 17.3% AMR, and 53.4% EUR. Result(s): We observed a significant enrichment of the minisatellite 54bp (1: 7829913-7829966 (GRCh38)) variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) PER3 rs57875989 4 allele. We observed significantly higher frequencies of the 4/4 variant: 59.2% when compared to the super control population frequency of 42.2% (n = 315; recessive: OR 1.9, CI 1.07 to 3.65, p < 0.02). Super controls were defined as participants without reported sleep issues or diagnosed sleep disorders. The MAF in the DSWPD group was 0.74 versus 0.62 in matched super controls. Allelic frequency varied across ancestries, with the highest MAF reported in East Asian populations and the lowest MAF reported in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. We have analyzed adjusting for population stratification. This variant is of particular interest as it is located in the coding region of VNTR (exon 18). Functionally, PER3 is phosphorylated by casein kinase 1 (CK1) and translocates to the nucleus to inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1 in the presence of PER1. The VNTR motif contains clusters of potential phosphorylation sites for CK1. Given the VNTR PER3 variant could change protein phosphorylation levels in addition to tertiary protein structure and also have interactions with binding partners, it is hypothesized that the VNTR would cause functional changes in PER3. The observed accumulation of the PER3 VNTR 4/4 supports prior literature describing evening-types and DSWPD patients as having greater frequencies of PER34/4 homozygotes; this effect can be as high as 75% homozygotes in DSWPD. Conclusion(s): These results demonstrate that, on average, DSWPD individuals are more likely to harbor variants within their core clock genes with particular enrichment of the VNTR variant, potentially leading to a pronounced delay in sleep period. This variant can further impact the response to treatment across carriers of the 4/4.

The authors considered whether the combination of high-flow nasal cannula and upper-body elevation could improve postoperative OSA. Method(s): This nonblinded randomized crossover study performed at a single university hospital investigated the effect on a modified apnea hypopnea index, based exclusively on the airflow signal without arterial oxygen saturation criteria (flow-based apnea hypopnea index, primary outcome), of high-flow nasal cannula (20 l . min-1with 40% oxygen concentration) with and without upper-body elevation in patients with moderate to severe OSA. Preoperative sleep studies were performed at home (control, no head-of-bed elevation) and in hospital (30-degree head-of-bed elevation). On the first and second postoperative nights, high-flow nasal cannula was applied with or without 30-degree head-of-bed elevation, assigned in random order to 23 eligible participants. Result(s): Twenty-two of the 23 (96%) accepted high-flow nasal cannula. Four participants resigned from the study. Control flow-based apnea hypopnea index (mean +/- SD, 60 +/- 12 events . h-1; n = 19) was reduced by 15 (95% CI, 6 to 30) events . h-1with head-of-bed elevation alone (P = 0.002), 10.9 (95% CI, 1 to 21) events . h-1with high-flow nasal cannula alone (P = 0.028), and 23 (95% CI, 13 to 32) events . h-1with combined head-of-bed elevation and high-flow nasal cannula (P < 0.001). Compared to sole high-flow nasal cannula, additional intervention with head-of-bed elevation significantly decreased flow-based apnea hypopnea index by 12 events . h-1(95% CI, 2 to 21; P = 0.022). High-flow nasal cannula, alone or in combination with head-of-bed elevation, also improved overnight oxygenation. No harmful events were observed. Conclusion(s): The combination of high-flow nasal cannula and upper-body elevation reduced OSA severity and nocturnal hypoxemia, suggesting a role for it as an alternate postoperative airway management strategy.Copyright © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The mainstream treatment for glioma is surgical resection; therefore, accurate resection can improve postoperative patient recovery. Purpose(s): Many studies have investigated surgical navigation guided by mixed reality, with good outcomes. However, the limitations of mixed reality, such as spatial drift caused by environmental changes, limit its clinical application. Therefore, we present a mixed reality surgical navigation system for glioma resection. Preoperative information can be fused precisely with the real patient with the spatial compensation method to achieve clinically suitable accuracy. Method(s): A head-mounted device was used to display virtual information, and a markerless spatial registration method was applied to precisely align the virtual anatomy with the real patient preoperatively. High-accuracy preoperative and intraoperative movement and spatial drift compensation methods were used to increase the positional accuracy of the mixed reality-guided glioma resection system when the patient's head is fixed to the bed frame. Several experiments were designed to validate the accuracy and efficacy of this system. Result(s): Phantom experiments were performed to test the efficacy and accuracy of this system under ideal conditions, and clinical tests were conducted to assess the performance of this system in clinical application. The accuracy of spatial registration was 1.18 mm in the phantom experiments and 1.86 mm in the clinical application. Conclusion(s): Herein, we present a mixed reality-based multimodality-fused surgical navigation system for assisting surgeons in intuitively identifying the glioma boundary intraoperatively. The experimental results indicate that this system has suitable accuracy and efficacy for clinical usage.Copyright © 2022 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:06Z,2022-08-24T07:29:06Z,NA,3963-3979,NA,6,49,NA,Med.

First 1014 nights, 4189 alarms occurred with average of 1.44/h, showing average sensitivity of 79.9% (median 75.4%) with mean PPV of 26.7% (median 11.1%) and false alarm rate of 0.2/hour. Over 90% of false alarms in children was due to heart rate (HR) part of the detection algorithm. To improve this rate, an adaptation was made such that the alarm was only triggered when the wearer was in horizontal position. For the remaining 497 nights, this was tested prospectively, 384 major seizures occurred. This resulted in mean PPV of 55.5% (median 58.1%) and a false alarm rate 0.08/h while maintaining a comparable mean sensitivity of 79.4% (median 93.2%). Significance: Seizure detection devices that are used in bed which depend on heartrate and movement show similar sensitivity in children and adults. However, children do show general higher false alarm rate, mostly triggered while awake. By correcting for body position, the false alarms can be limited to a level that comes close to that in adults.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

The role of machine learning in the ICU is evolving but currently limited to diagnostic and prognostic values. A decision tree (DT) algorithm is a simple and intuitive machine learning method that provides sequential nonlinear analysis of variables. It is simple and might be a valuable tool for bedside physicians during COVID-19 to predict ICU outcomes and help in critical decision-making like end-of-life decisions and bed allocation in the event of limited ICU bed capacities. Herein, we utilized a machine learning DT algorithm to describe the association of a predefined set of variables and 28-day ICU outcome in adult COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. We highlight the value of utilizing a machine learning DT algorithm in the ICU at the time of a COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): This was a prospective and multicenter cohort study involving 14 hospitals in Saudi Arabia. We included critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU between March 1, 2020, and October 31, 2020. The predictors of 28-day ICU mortality were identified using two predictive models: conventional logistic regression and DT analyses. Result(s): There were 1468 critically ill COVID-19 patients included in the study. The 28-day ICU mortality was 540 (36.8 %), and the 90-day mortality was 600 (40.9 %). The DT algorithm identified five variables that were integrated into the algorithm to predict 28-day ICU outcomes: need for intubation, need for vasopressors, age, gender, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Conclusion(s): DT is a simple tool that might be utilized in the ICU to identify critically ill COVID-19 patients who are at high risk of 28-day ICU mortality. However, further studies and external validation are still required.Copyright © 2022 The Authors",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:06Z,2022-08-24T07:29:06Z,NA,826-834,NA,7,15,NA,J. Infect.

With the increased demand for unobtrusive yet quantifiable respiratory monitoring, many technologies have been proposed recently. However, there are challenges to be addressed for such technologies to enable widespread use. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using load cell sensors embedded on a hospital bed for monitoring respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (TV). We propose a globalized machine learning (ML)-based algorithm for estimating TV without the requirement of subject-specific calibration or training. In a study of 15 healthy subjects performing respiratory tasks in four different postures, the outputs from four load cell channels and the reference spirometer were recorded simultaneously. A signal processing pipeline was implemented to extract features that capture respiratory movement and the respiratory effects on the cardiac (i.e., ballistocardiogram, BCG) signals. The proposed RR estimation algorithm achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.6 breaths per minute (brpm) against the ground truth RR from the spirometer. The TV estimation results demonstrated that combining all three axes of the low-frequency force signals and the BCG heartbeat features best quantifies the respiratory effects of TV. The model resulted in a correlation and RMSE between the estimated and true TV values of 0.85 and 0.23 L, respectively, in the posture independent model without electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. This study suggests that load cell sensors already existing in certain hospital beds can be used for convenient and continuous respiratory monitoring in general care settings.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:06Z,2022-08-24T07:29:06Z,NA,3330-3341,NA,7,26,NA,IEEE J.

However, it is often limited by the need for adherence to self-measurement, charging and self-application of wearables, or usage of apps. Here, we describe a non-contact, adherence-independent sensor, that when placed beneath the legs of a patient's home bed, longitudinally monitors total body weight, detailed respiratory signals, and ballistocardiograms for months, without requiring any active patient participation. Accompanying algorithms separate weight and respiratory signals when the bed is shared by a partner or a pet. Validation studies demonstrate quantitative equivalence to commercial sensors during overnight sleep studies. The feasibility of detecting obstructive and central apneas, cardiopulmonary coupling, and the hemodynamic consequences of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia is also established. Real-world durability is demonstrated by 3 months of in-home monitoring in an example patient with heart failure and ischemic cardiomyopathy as he recovers from coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. BedScales is the first sensor to measure adherence-independent total body weight as well as longitudinal cardiopulmonary physiology. As such, it has the potential to create a multidimensional picture of chronic disease, learn signatures of impending hospitalization, and enable optimization of care in the home.Copyright © 2021.

Several studies influence physiological signal monitoring through a centralized approach using star topology in regular activities like standing, walking, sitting, and running which are considered active postures. Unlike regular activities like walking, standing, sitting, and running, the in-bed sleep posture monitoring of a subject is highly necessary for those who have undergone surgery, victims of breathing problems, and victims of COVID-19 for whom oxygen imbalance is a major issue as the mortality rate in sleep is high due to unattended patients. Suggestions from the medical field state that the patients with the above-mentioned issues are highly suggested to follow the prone sleep posture that enables them to maintain the oxygen level in the human body. A distributed model of communication is used where mesh topology is used for the data packets to be carried in a relay fashion to the sink. Heartbeat rate (HBR) and image monitoring of the subject during sleep are closely monitored and taken as input to the proposed posture prediction-Bayesian network (PP-BN) to predict the consecutive postures to increase the accuracy rate of posture recognition. The accuracy rate of the model outperforms the existing classification and prediction algorithms which take the cleaned dataset as input for better prediction results.Copyright © 2022 A.

However, some individual behaviors are also related to decreased sleep quality and its possible consequences. In this regard, bedtime procrastination plays an important role in decreasing the quality of sleep, which may be related to the onset of diseases such as depression, obesity and cognitive deficit. Thus, the Bedtime Procrastination Scale (BPS) was developed to measure various aspects of this phenomenon. Objective(s): To develop a Brazilian Portuguese version of the Bedtime Procrastination Scale and examine its psychometric properties. Method(s): The data was obtained from online surveys using the Brazilian adaptation of the BPS. The validation followed the steps of preparation, translation, reconciliation of translations, back-translation, review, pre-test and validation. Exploratory Factor Analysis with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Technique was used to extract the factors. To assess the factorability of the generated matrix, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett's Sphericity tests were used. KMO values above 0.8 and statistical significance (p <= 0.05) of the Bartlett Sphericity Test were considered adequate. Eigenvalues above 1 were used to demarcate the number of factors to be extracted. Varimax rotation was used to improve the interpretation of the extracted factors and subsequently, each item selected to represent the underlying construct were those with a factor load >= 0.4. Result(s): In a sample of 495 volunteers (Age = 31.61 (12.03), 65.9% female), the BPS was applied, with results ranging from 9 to 45. The students scored 32 (9) and the teachers 29 (10). The KaiserMeyer-Olkin test (KMO) (0.914) and Bartlett's sphericity (p <0.001) indicated the adequacy of the factorial matrix. As for the consistency of the extracted factors, there was greater precision and reliability in factor 1 (Cronbach's alpha 0.9). Conclusion(s): This research validated the Bedtime Procrastination Scale to Brazilian Portuguese. It showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic social isolation, the student and teacher body procrastinated the bedtime even without labor activities for the next day.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:07Z,2022-08-24T07:29:07Z,NA,72-73,NA,Supplement 3,15,NA,Sleep Sci.,NA,Congresso Brasileiro do Sono 2021.

Staff monitoring of motion and sleep is intermittent and resource intense. Wearable actigraphic devices are poorly tolerated and limited to limb motion. Here we demonstrate continuous AI video monitoring in the ICU to provide alwayson, unobtrusive patient activity monitoring. Method(s): We conducted a pilot study of AI video monitoring in the Duke University Hospital Medical Intensive Care Unit. Video carts continuously recorded data on encrypted hard drives. Second-by-second AI analysis generated binary motion ""counts"" that were summed to generate our patient motion metric: counts per minute (CPM). Scene intelligence from AI object and people detectors provided room environment information. These data streams along with de-identified (blurred) video data were used to generate prototype graphical and visual summaries of patient activity patterns and the hospital room environment. Result(s): We enrolled 22 patients and collected 2155 hours (116 days) of video. Representative time-series data streams are shown in the Figure (top left). These data were acquired from a 76-year-old with liver failure and an escalating nasal cannula oxygen requirement who was endotracheally intubated on the subsequent day. Note 1) the declining patient activity as the patient deteriorates and 2) the significant bedside activity (high acuity) throughout the day. We developed a prototype ""overnight report"" that summarizes patient activity and room environment. The Figure (bottom left) shows the overnight report for a 54-year-old post-COVID-19 patient admitted to the MICU for respiratory failure with hypoactive delirium that resolved per CAM-ICU on day 5 of data collection. Notably, our report demonstrates significant overnight movement, possibly consistent with a mixed or hyperactive delirium. To visually summarize patient motion, we generated activity ""heat maps"" over 10-minute intervals. As a control, we showed that the intubated and sedated liver failure patient generated a still heat map (Figure upper right). Further, we visualized daytime hypoactivity/sleep in the delirious post-COVID patient (Figure lower right), suggesting disrupted circadian rhythm, giving additional context to the negative CAM assessment. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated the feasibility of AI to monitor patient activity in a quaternary-care MICU. Our method has advantages compared to wearable actigraphic methods for monitoring patient activity, including being unobtrusive and being able to visualize and summarize wholebody motion.

However, the quality of ultrasound imaging depends on skill level of the operator. Ultrasonography by 2D imaging relies on the ability of the medical professional, to subjectively manipulate a 3D model of the anatomic and pathologic structures in their head [1]. Obtaining US images using a robot and constructing organ models of individual would reduce the burden on unskilled medical professionals and could be used in treatment planning, measurement of therapeutic response, preoperative simulation, surgical monitoring, and the process of communication between patients and medical professional (Informed consent). The purpose of this study was to construct a simple and convenient phantom kidney model suitable for probe localization estimation, by deep learning using a camera and organ segmentation. Methods The Robotics Ultrasound Diagnosis System (RUDS) [2] was applied to implement our method. RUDS comprises a tip component for fine alignment with the organs, a bed component for rough alignment with the patient, and a support component for tip movement (including sliding, fanning, compression and rotation). The tip has a spring escape mechanism because it is difficult to measure probe movement with the RUDS measuring instrument without excessive compression of the patient. For this reason, we used ORB-SLAM2, a Visual SLAM and base ORB feature, for estimation of probe localization, and performed real-scale estimation using a depth camera (Intel Realsense D435). Localization accuracy was improved using a calibration ChArUco board that was placed about 20 cm away from the camera. The accuracy of SLAM was evaluated as MAE (mean absolute error) and RMSE (root mean square error). The ground truth data were obtained by motion capture (OptiTrack Flex3, NaturalPoint, Inc.), during closed loop orbital motion of the probe in the direction of the body axis. This trial was performed 6 times. Noise in localization data due to SLAM was removed using a moving average filter that averages the before and after data. The obtained US images were segmented by U-Net to extract the target organ. In learning, 1640 images were used in training, 174 images were used in validation, and 100 images were used in the test datasets. Comparisons were made using various encoders (EfficinetNet-b0, EfficientNet-b5, ResNet50, and Vgg16) and the most accurate encoder was applied. IoU and Dice Loss evaluation index were used. The loss function was Dice Loss and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) was used as the optimizer. A 3D model was constructed by combining the segmentation images with the corresponding estimated localization data. US images were obtained in the minor axis direction of the kidney along the major axis direction. Results The accuracy of probe localization estimation was within 1 mm for MAE and RMSE, and maximum error was 3.23 mm. The farther from the starting point, the greater the position estimation error due to the influence of accumulation error. Maximum error was 2.27 mm after removing noise. The use of a moving average filter improved estimation accuracy by reducing the impact of outliers on the estimates. This technique could identify the approximate location of the lesion and can be applied in diagnosis. In segmentation, IoU of Resnet was 0.9929, Dice Loss was 0.0037; Resnet had the highest precision among the four encoders. Figure 1 shows the constructed 3D kidney model. Conclusion Location estimation using only a camera and application of a noise filter was simple, convenient, accurate, and effective. Accuracy could be further improved by changing the features. As the probe was moved only in the body axis direction in this study, the system needs to be improved to incorporate tilting, rocking, and rotating motions and to control contact force between the probe and the patient's body. It is difficult to obtain a quality US image using a sliding motion because the body is not flat, and shadows are caused by areas of poor skin contact. Therefore, a system is required that avoids shadowing with tilting, rocking, and rotating motions. And these motions enable imaging of the major axis direction of the kidney along the minor axis direction. This method enables the construction of 3D model with little scatter. This study used a phantom as the target. In future, we aim to test this method on a real body as the target, and to develop for a clinical setting.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:07Z,2022-08-24T07:29:07Z,NA,S40-S41,NA,SUPPL 1,17,NA,Int. J. Comput.

Here, we de -velop a 24-hour actigraphy classifier to overcome limitations in specificity (accuracy on wake epochs), which typically afflict in-bed focused algorithms. Method(s): Four datasets scored via either PSG or direct observation of daytime wakefulness were combined (n=52 participants of mean age 49.8yrs, age range 19 - 86; 52% male; 221 total days/ nights). Actigraphy (counts) and PSG (RPSGT-staged epochs) were temporally aligned. A model was trained to transform a time-series actigraphy counts to a time series of sleep-wake clas-sifications, using the TensorFlow library for Python. 5-fold cross-validation was used to train and evaluate the model. Classification performance was compared to the output of the Spectrum device threshold of 'medium'. Result(s): The developed classifier was compared to the Spectrum classifications across the 24-hour intervals. The developed classifier had higher accuracy (95.4% vs. 76.8%), higher specificity (95.9% vs. 68.9%) and higher balanced-accuracy (95.2% vs. 81.6%) relative to the Spectrum classifications, each assessed via paired-sample t-test. Sensitivity did not statistically differ (94.5% vs. 94.4%). Conclusion(s): The model trained and evaluated on 24-hour data outperformed the existing algorithm output in terms of overall ac-curacy, specificity, and balanced accuracy, while sensitivity did not significantly differ. A model trained on 24-hour data may be more appropriate for analyses of freely living people, or older popula-tions where napping is more common.

Detected based on an overnight sleep study is called polysomnography (PSG); OSA still remains undiagnosed in majority of the population mainly attributed to lack of awareness. To overcome the limitations posed by PSG such as patient discomfort and overnight hospitalization, newer technologies are being explored. In addition, challenges associated with current management of OSA using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), etc. presents several pitfalls. Areas Covered: Conventional and modern detection/management techniques including PSG, CPAP, smart wearable/pillows, bio-motion sensors, etc., have both pros and cons. To fulfill the limitations in OSA diagnostics, there is an imperative need for new technology for screening of symptomatic and more importantly asymptomatic OSA patients to reduce the risk of several associated life-threatening comorbidities. In this line, molecular marker-based diagnostics have shown great promises. Expert Opinion: A detailed overview is presented on the OSA management and diagnostic approaches and recent advances in the molecular screening methods. The potentials of biomarker-based detection and its limitations are also portrayed and a comparison between the standard, current modern approaches, and promising futuristic technologies for OSA diagnostics and management is set forth.

We develop the Hemodynamic Stability Index (HSI), which highlights situational awareness of possible hemodynamic instability occurring at the bedside and to prompt assessment for potential hemodynamic interventions. Method(s): We used an ensemble of decision trees to obtain a real-time risk score that predicts the initiation of hemodynamic interventions an hour into the future. We developed the model using the eICU Research Institute (eRI) database, based on adult ICU admissions from 2012 to 2016. A total of 208,375 ICU stays met the inclusion criteria, with 32,896 patients (prevalence = 18%) experiencing at least one instability event where they received one of the interventions during their stay. Predictors included vital signs, laboratory measurements, and ventilation settings. Result(s): HSI showed significantly better performance compared to single parameters like systolic blood pressure and shock index (heart rate/systolic blood pressure) and showed good generalization across patient subgroups. HSI AUC was 0.82 and predicted 52% of all hemodynamic interventions with a lead time of 1-h with a specificity of 92%. In addition to predicting future hemodynamic interventions, our model provides confidence intervals and a ranked list of clinical features that contribute to each prediction. Importantly, HSI can use a sparse set of physiologic variables and abstains from making a prediction when the confidence is below an acceptable threshold. Conclusion(s): The HSI algorithm provides a single score that summarizes hemodynamic status in real time using multiple physiologic parameters in patient monitors and electronic medical records (EMR). Importantly, HSI is designed for real-world deployment, demonstrating generalizability, strong performance under different data availability conditions, and providing model explanation in the form of feature importance and prediction confidence.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:07Z,2022-08-24T07:29:07Z,NA,388,NA,1,25,NA,Crit.

Vocal motor patterns require close coordination of neural circuits governing the muscles of the larynx, jaw, and respiratory system. In the elaborate vocalization of Alston's singing mouse (Scotinomys teguina) each note of its rapid, frequency-modulated trill is accompanied by equally rapid modulation of breath and gape. To elucidate the neural circuitry underlying this behavior, we introduced the polysynaptic retrograde neuronal tracer pseudorabies virus (PRV) into the cricothyroid and digastricus muscles, which control frequency modulation and jaw opening, respectively. Each virus singly labels ipsilateral motoneurons (nucleus ambiguus for cricothyroid, and motor trigeminal nucleus for digastricus). We find that the two isogenic viruses heavily and bilaterally colabel neurons in the gigantocellular reticular formation, a putative central pattern generator. The viruses also show strong colabeling in compartments of the midbrain including the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and the parabrachial nucleus, two structures strongly implicated in vocalizations. In the forebrain, regions important to social cognition and energy balance both exhibit extensive colabeling. This includes the paraventricular and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus, preoptic area, extended amygdala, central amygdala, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Finally, we find doubly labeled neurons in M1 motor cortex previously described as laryngeal, as well as in the prelimbic cortex, which indicate these cortical regions play a role in vocal production. The progress of both viruses is broadly consistent with vertebrate-general patterns of vocal circuitry, as well as with circuit models derived from primate literature.Copyright © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:07Z,2022-08-24T07:29:07Z,NA,2075-2099,NA,12,530,NA,J.

AIM: Proof-of-concept demonstration that a multimode optical fiber (MMF) specklegram sensor array can be used to detect and image movement on a bed. APPROACH: Seven MMFs are attached to the upper surface of a mattress such that they cross in a 3x4 array. The specklegram output is monitored using a single laser and single camera and movement on the fibers is monitored by calculating a rolling zero-normalized cross-correlation. A 3x4 image is formed by comparing the signal at each crossing point between two fibers. RESULT(S): The MMF sensor array can detect and image movement on a bed, including getting on and off the bed, rolling on the bed, and breathing.

This deficiency explains the persistence of freehand placement of external ventricular drains, which has an inherent risk of inaccurate positioning, multiple passes, tract hemorrhage, and injury to adjacent brain parenchyma. Here, the authors introduce and validate a novel image registration and real-time tracking system for frameless stereotactic neuronavigation and catheter placement in the nonimmobilized patient. METHOD(S): Computer vision technology was used to develop an algorithm that performed near-continuous, automatic, and marker-less image registration. The program fuses a subject's preprocedure CT scans to live 3D camera images (Snap-Surface), and patient movement is incorporated by artificial intelligence-driven recalibration (Real-Track). The surface registration error (SRE) and target registration error (TRE) were calculated for 5 cadaveric heads that underwent serial movements (fast and slow velocity roll, pitch, and yaw motions) and several test conditions, such as surgical draping with limited anatomical exposure and differential subject lighting. Six catheters were placed in each cadaveric head (30 total placements) with a simulated sterile technique. Postprocedure CT scans allowed comparison of planned and actual catheter positions for user error calculation. RESULT(S): Registration was successful for all 5 cadaveric specimens, with an overall mean (+/- standard deviation) SRE of 0.429 +/- 0.108 mm for the catheter placements. Accuracy of TRE was maintained under 1.2 mm throughout specimen movements of low and high velocities of roll, pitch, and yaw, with the slowest recalibration time of 0.23 seconds. There were no statistically significant differences in SRE when the specimens were draped or fully undraped (p = 0.336). Performing registration in a bright versus a dimly lit environment had no statistically significant effect on SRE (p = 0.742 and 0.859, respectively). For the catheter placements, mean TRE was 0.862 +/- 0.322 mm and mean user error (difference between target and actual catheter tip) was 1.674 +/- 1.195 mm. CONCLUSION(S): This computer vision-based registration system provided real-time tracking of cadaveric heads with a recalibration time of less than one-quarter of a second with submillimetric accuracy and enabled catheter placements with millimetric accuracy. Using this approach to guide bedside ventriculostomy could reduce complications, improve safety, and be extrapolated to other frameless stereotactic applications in awake, nonimmobilized patients.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:07Z,2022-08-24T07:29:07Z,NA,1-10,NA,"(Robertson) Department of Neurosurgery, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston",NA,NA,J Neurosurg,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexb&NEWS=N&AN=636420754,*algorithm; *computer vision; *frameless stereotactic procedure; *neuronavigation; *ventriculostomy catheter; adult; article; artificial intelligence; calculation; camera; complication; controlled study; drug safety; human; illumination; image registration; motion; pitch; simulation; wakefulness; x-ray computed tomography,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A repeated measures design pilot study of 14 participants with mild-moderate insomnia symptom severity (self-reported on the Insomnia Severity Index) was conducted to determine the effects of BFV, and traditional standing wave vibration (SWV) on sleep latency and sleep electrocortical activity. Participants were monitored using high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG). Sleep latency was compared between treatment conditions. A trend of decreasing sleep latency due to BFV was found for unequivocal sleep latency (p <= 0.068). Neural complexity during wake, N1, and N2 stages were compared using Multi-Scale Sample Entropy (MSE), which demonstrated significantly lower MSE between wake and N2 stages (p <= 0.002). During N2 sleep, BFV showed lower MSE than the control session in the left frontoparietal region. As a measure of information integration, reduced entropy may indicate that BFV decreases conscious awareness during deeper stages of sleep. SWV caused reduced alpha activity and increased delta activity during wake. BFV caused increased delta activity during N2 sleep. These preliminary results suggest that BFV may help decrease sleep latency, reduce conscious awareness, and increase sleep drive expression during deeper stages of sleep. SWV may be beneficial for decreasing expression of arousal and increasing expression of sleep drive during wake, implying that beat frequency vibration may be beneficial to sleep.Copyright CCBY",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:07Z,2022-08-24T07:29:07Z,NA,NA,NA,(Himes) mechanical engineering department at BYU.,NA,NA,IEEE Trans.

The developed recognition system will be used to implement a natural human-machine interface to move a medical bed by means of the slight movements of patients with reduced mobility. Methods and material: Our proposal uses pressure map sequences as input and presents a novel system based on artificial neural networks to recognise the movement intentions. The system analyses each pressure map in real-time and classifies the raw information into output classes which represent these intentions. The complexity of the recognition problem is high because of the multiple body characteristics and distinct ways of communicating intentions. To address this problem, a complete processing chain was developed consisting of image processing algorithms, a knowledge extraction process, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classification model. Result(s): Different configurations of the MLP have been investigated and quantitatively compared. The accuracy of our approach is high, obtaining an accuracy of 87%. The model was compared with five well-known classification paradigms. The performance of a reduced model, obtained by through feature selection algorithms, was found to be better and less time-consuming than the original model. The whole proposal has been validated with real patients in pre-clinical tests using the final medical bed prototype. Conclusion(s): The proposed approach produced very promising results, outperforming existing classification approaches. The excellent behaviour of the recognition system will enable its use in controlling the movements of the bed, in several degrees of freedom, by the patient with his/her own body. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, sleep is often disturbed in preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We aimed to develop an automated algorithm based on routinely measured vital parameters to classify sleep-wake states of preterm infants in real-time at the bedside. METHOD(S): In this study, sleep-wake state observations were obtained in 1-minute epochs using a behavioral scale developed in-house while vital signs were recorded simultaneously. Three types of vital parameter data, namely, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, were collected at a low-frequency sampling rate of 0.4 Hz. A supervised machine learning workflow was used to train a classifier to predict sleep-wake states. Independent training (n = 37) and validation datasets were used (n = 9). Finally, a setup was designed for real-time implementation at the bedside. RESULT(S): The macro-averaged area-under-the-receiver-operator-characteristic (AUROC) of the automated sleep staging algorithm ranged between 0.69 and 0.82 for the training data, and 0.61 and 0.78 for the validation data. The algorithm provided the most accurate prediction for wake states (AUROC = 0.80). These findings were well validated on an independent sample (AUROC = 0.77). CONCLUSION(S): With this study, to the best of our knowledge, a reliable, non-obtrusive, and real-time sleep staging algorithm was developed for the first time for preterm infants. Deploying this algorithm in the NICU environment may assist and adapt bedside clinical work based on infants' sleep-wake states, potentially promoting the early brain development and well-being of preterm infants.Copyright © Sleep Research Society 2022.

The RDT COVID-19 Observational Study (RCOS) collected clinical data from patients with COVID-19 admitted regardless of the severity of their symptoms in a general hospital in India. We aimed to develop and validate a simple bedside prognostic score to predict the risk of hypoxaemia or death. Results. 4035 patients were included in the development cohort and 2046 in the validation cohort. The primary outcome occurred in 961 (23.8%) and 548 (26.8%) patients in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The final model included 12 variables: age, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, urea, C-reactive protein, sodium, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. In the validation cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) was 0.907 (95% CI, 0.892-0.922), and the Brier Score was 0.098. The decision curve analysis showed good clinical utility in hypothetical scenarios where the admission of patients was decided according to the prognostic index. When the prognostic index was used to predict mortality in the validation cohort, the AUROCC was 0.947 (95% CI, 0.925-0.97) and the Brier score was 0.0188. Conclusions. The RCOS prognostic index could help improve the decision making in the current COVID-19 pandemic, especially in resource-limited settings with poor healthcare infrastructure such as India. However, implementation in other settings is needed to cross-validate and verify our findings.Copyright © 2022 Gerardo Alvarez-Uria et al.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:08Z,2022-08-24T07:29:08Z,NA,2360478,NA,"(Alvarez-Uria, Midde) Department Of Infectious Diseases, Rural Development Trust Hospital, AP Bathalapalli, India",2022,NA,Interdiscip.

This is particularly relevant in the dorsal part of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd) in primates where neurons encode complex motion patterns in order to support a variety of behaviors. A sparse decomposition model based on a dimensionality reduction principle known as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) was previously shown to account for a wide range of monkey MSTd visual response properties. This model resulted in sparse, ""parts-based"" representations that could be regarded as basis flow fields, a linear superposition of which accurately reconstructed the input stimuli. This model provided evidence that the seemingly-complex response properties of MSTd may be a by-product of MSTd neurons performing dimensionality reduction on their input. However, an open question is how a neural circuit could carry out this function. In the current study, we propose a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model of MSTd based on evolved spike-timing dependent plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling (STDP-H) learning rules. We demonstrate that the SNN model learns compressed and efficient representations of the input patterns similar to the patterns that emerge from NMF, resulting in MSTd-like receptive fields observed in monkeys. This SNN model suggests that STDP-H observed in the nervous system may be performing a similar function as NMF with sparsity constraints, which provides a test bed for mechanistic theories of how MSTd may efficiently encode complex patterns of visual motion to support robust self-motion perception.Significance Statement:The brain may use dimensionality reduction and sparse coding to efficiently represent stimuli under metabolic constraints. Neurons in monkey area MSTd respond to complex optic flow patterns resulting from self-motion. We developed a spiking neural network model that showed MSTd-like response properties can emerge from evolving spike-timing dependent plasticity with homeostatic synaptic scaling (STDP-H) parameters of the connections between area MT and MSTd. Simulated MSTd neurons formed a sparse, reduced population code capable of encoding perceptual variables important for self-motion perception. This model demonstrates that complex neuronal responses observed in MSTd may emerge from efficient coding, and suggests that neurobiological plasticity, like STDP-H, may contribute to reducing the dimensions of input stimuli and allowing spiking neurons to learn sparse representations.Copyright © 2022 the authors.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:08Z,2022-08-24T07:29:08Z,NA,NA,NA,"(Chen, Krichmar) Departments of Cognitive Sciences and",NA,NA,J Neurosci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=638304516,*dimensionality reduction; *movement perception; *spike; animal experiment; animal model; article; association cortex; Haplorhini; learning; nerve cell; nerve potential; non-negative matrix factorization; nonhuman; optic flow; receptive field; simulation; spiking neural network; synapse,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We investigated how sleep and having a schema might benefit initial learning followed by rearranged and expanded memoranda. We concurrently examined the contributions of sleep spindles and slow-wave sleep to learning outcomes. Method(s): Fifty-three adolescents were randomly assigned to an 8 h Nap schedule (6.5 h nocturnal sleep with a 90-minute daytime nap) or an 8 h No-Nap, nocturnal-only sleep schedule. The study spanned 14 nights, simulating successive school weeks. We utilized a transitive inference task involving hierarchically ordered faces. Initial learning to set up the schema was followed by rearrangement of the hierarchy (accommodation) and hierarchy expansion (assimilation). The expanded sequence was restudied. Recall of hierarchical knowledge was tested after initial learning and at multiple points for all subsequent phases. As a control, both groups underwent a No-schema condition where the hierarchy was introduced and modified without opportunity to set up a schema. Electroencephalography accompanied the multiple sleep opportunities. Result(s): There were main effects of Nap schedule and Schema condition evidenced by superior recall of initial learning, reordered and expanded memoranda. Improved recall was consistently associated with higher fast spindle density but not slow-wave measures. This was true for both nocturnal sleep and daytime naps. Conclusion(s): A sleep schedule incorporating regular nap opportunities compared to one that only had nocturnal sleep benefited building of robust and flexible schemas, facilitating recall of the subsequently rearranged and expanded structured knowledge. These benefits appear to be strongly associated with fast spindles.

The National Institutes of General Medical Science sepsis research working group recommendations call for application of new research approaches in extant clinical data sets to improve efficiency of early trials of new sepsis therapies. Our objective is to apply machine learning approaches to derive computable 24-h sepsis phenotypes to facilitate personalized enrollment in early anti-inflammatory trials targeting these conditions. Method(s): We applied consensus, k-means clustering analysis to our extant PHENOtyping sepsis-induced Multiple organ failure Study (PHENOMS) dataset of 404 children. 24-hour computable phenotypes are derived using 25 available bedside variables including C-reactive protein and ferritin. Result(s): Four computable phenotypes (PedSep-A, B, C, and D) are derived. Compared to all other phenotypes, PedSep-A patients (n = 135; 2% mortality) were younger and previously healthy, with the lowest C-reactive protein and ferritin levels, the highest lymphocyte and platelet counts, highest heart rate, and lowest creatinine (p < 0.05); PedSep-B patients (n = 102; 12% mortality) were most likely to be intubated and had the lowest Glasgow Coma Scale Score (p < 0.05); PedSep-C patients (n = 110; mortality 10%) had the highest temperature and Glasgow Coma Scale Score, least pulmonary failure, and lowest lymphocyte counts (p < 0.05); and PedSep-D patients (n = 56, 34% mortality) had the highest creatinine and number of organ failures, including renal, hepatic, and hematologic organ failure, with the lowest platelet counts (p < 0.05). PedSep-D had the highest likelihood of developing thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure (Adj OR 47.51 95% CI [18.83-136.83], p < 0.0001) and macrophage activation syndrome (Adj OR 38.63 95% CI [13.26-137.75], p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): Four computable phenotypes are derived, with PedSep-D being optimal for enrollment in early personalized anti-inflammatory trials targeting thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure and macrophage activation syndrome in pediatric sepsis.

Our primary goal was to simplify the analog and digital processing usually required in these kinds of systems while retaining high performance. A novel sensing approach is proposed consisting of a white LED facing a digital light detector. This detector provides precise measurements of the variations of the light intensity of the incident light due to the vibrations of the bed produced by the subject's breathing, heartbeat, or activity. Four small springs, acting as a bandpass filter, connect the boards where the LED and the detector are mounted. Owing to the mechanical bandpass filtering caused by the compressed springs, the proposed system generates a BCG signal that reflects the main frequencies of the heartbeat, breathing, and movement of the lying subject. Without requiring any analog signal processing, this device continuously transmits the measurements to a microcontroller through a two-wire communication protocol, where they are processed to provide an estimation of the parameters of interest in configurable time intervals. The final information of interest is wirelessly sent to the user's smartphone by means of a Bluetooth connection. For evaluation purposes, the proposed system has been compared with typical BCG systems showing excellent performance for different subject positions. Moreover, applied postprocessing methods have shown good behavior for information separation from a single-channel signal. Therefore, the determination of the heart rate, breathing rate, and activity of the patient is achieved through a highly simplified signal processing without any need for analog signal conditioning.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:08Z,2022-08-24T07:29:08Z,NA,NA,NA,11,22,NA,Sensors (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Switzerland Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=638214484,*ballistocardiography; *BCG vaccine; heart rate; human; physiology; procedures; signal processing; sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The majority of hypoglycemic episodes occur during sleep, at a time when hypoglycaemia awareness is attenuated. Recurrent nocturnal hypoglycaemia can lead to impaired awareness of hypoglycemia and is associated with the dead-in-bed syndrome. This work aims to provide bedtime decision support to people with T1D, to minimize the risk of NH. Method(s): We present the design and development of binary classifiers that can be used to predict NH (<3.9mmol/L). Using data collected from a 6-months study of adult participants with T1D under free-living conditions (n = 37, 15F, mean+/-std TIR (%) = 63.1+/-15.5), we extract daytime features from continuous glucose monitor (CGM) sensors, administered insulin, meal and physical activity information. We use these features to train and test two machine learning algorithms; Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Result(s): At population-level model, SVM outperforms RF algorithm with a ROC-AUC 73.79% (95% CI, 70.92%-76.67%). Additionally, for some participants, individual models can achieve higher ROC-AUC score up to 85%. We also show that the most important predictors come from the statistical and frequency domain extracted from CGM time series, whereas insulin, meals and physical activity do not contribute as much. Conclusion(s): The proposed algorithm is a potential viable approach to inform people with T1D about their risk of NH before it occurs. Additional datasets will be used to prove the generalization power of the algorithm.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:08Z,2022-08-24T07:29:08Z,NA,A226,NA,SUPPL 1,24,NA,Diabetes Technol.

This formidable challenge is still a dream, given the presently occurring exceedingly high (>95%) attrition rates of NCEs. As a solution we envisage exploiting advanced AI (artificial intelligence) algorithms. In fact, very recent AI implemented programs proved remarkably effective and accurate in predicting the 3D architecture of (any) protein, starting from the amino-acid sequence only. The same accuracy could not be obtained using classical conformational studies. Apart from these breakthrough results, AI algorithms could be profitably used to extract valuable information from the huge amount of data so far accumulated from previous studies.

Proximie is an augmented reality (AR) platform that can display up to 4 native camera views, with live or semi live telementoring. It can optimise ergonomics of the surgeon at the console (2), and robotic instrument orientation. We describe the utilisation of Proximie as a step-by-step guide in a robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Surgical Technique: Author V. P. performed a transperitoneal multiport da Vinci Xi RARP with the Proximie platform: a laptop computer, multiple HD webcams, microphones and speakers. Using an HDMI cable to the Intuitive Surgical tower, output display from the console and an additional laparoscopic tower is shown. Each webcam was mounted to the side armrests of the console, directed at the surgeon's hands. An independent 'drop in' laparoscope via an additional 5mm left upper quadrant port was utilised. Observers can visualise the AR platform's recordings on a laptop and/or smartphone. A PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) camera can capture the operating room, bedside assistant, ports and patient position. Our video demonstrates three of four camera views for posture, forearm, wrist, hand, and finger orientation, relative to the translated robotic steps. A pincer grasp of the endowrist manipulator during anastomosis allows optimal robotic wrist rotation. The second laparoscopic camera view demonstrated intracorporeal angles of robotic arm and bedside assistant's instrument position for critical steps such as nerve sparing and anastomosis (3). The console time was 100 minutes, no intraoperative complications, or delay in image transmission occurred with utilising the platform. Considerations: An AR platform can create deeper learning for RARP in real time or recorded sessions. Two-way verbal and visual communication with ability to annotate on screen, allows long distance mentoring. The platform's utility can be accessed in anywhere, to project surgeons beyond their immediate environment. This allows for democratisation of access to high volume institutions and their evolution of techniques (4), to assist patients globally. Potential developments are artificial intelligence (AI) networks analysing repository of such recorded data, to identify intraoperative hand motion and robotic instrument tracking. AR is a pertinent building block to enhance robotic training, skill dissemination, precision medicine (5) and surgery overall.Copyright © 2022.

Recent research on image-based screening drives this effort to investigate the feasibility of interpreting the inherent nutritional state from multidimensional human body images. However, anthropometric databases are becoming increasingly essential and grow in parallel to achieve efficient system designs. Typically, learning models on anthropometric databases require voluminous datasets, and obtaining huge volumes of labeled data for supervised algorithms can be challenging due to the time and cost complexity required to classify data points. This paper presents a novel imaging-based strategy in an augmented environment to quantify the human anthropometric features with blockchain-based transfer learning to generate a diagnosis report. It includes evaluating the attributes such as height, weight, waist, knee-length from an image using augmented reality and blockchain-based transfer learning for diagnostic accuracy. We developed a novel skeleton known as FETTLE with ARKit to determine the role of body measures for assessing nutritional conditions and body weight from human body images. It forms an instantly applicable technique aimed at evaluating children's growth patterns all through their initial ages. The FETTLE app can also be operated on bedridden people as a screening mechanism to spot their risk of pressure ulcers and undernutrition, followed by a more structured examination. Our approach is superior in accuracy measures with consortium blockchain-based learning context with privacy-preserved medical data sharing at 1014 transactions per second and high-end user experience and interaction. Our framework is proved to gain about 97.26% validation accuracy on anthropoid images.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:08Z,2022-08-24T07:29:08Z,NA,23,NA,1,11,NA,Netw.

To determine which baseline characteristics, especially clinically variables like pain, stiffness, physical functioning and disease variables, are associated with incident hip OA within 10 years in first presenters with hip complaints. Methods. Data were obtained from the nationwide prospective Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee (CHECK) study (n=1002). Incident hip OA was defined as fulfilling the clinical ACR criteria for hip OA, a Kellgren and Lawrence score >=2 with hip pain, or received a hip replacement during follow-up. Baseline measurements were used of participants with hip complaints and without hip OA. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the number of correlated variables. Associations between baseline characteristics (including PCA components) and incident hip OA were investigated using logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex and BMI. Results. In total, 312 participants (85% female and 98% Caucasian) were included, 181 developed hip OA. PCA resulted in four components. Incident hip OA was associated with (i) component 1 (general presence of pain and symptoms) [odds ratio (OR)=1.46 (95%CI: 1.08, 1.98)], (ii) component 3 (relatively high levels of pain during shopping/walking combined with less difficulty with putting socks on/off and rising from bed) [OR=1.58 (95%CI: 1.18, 2.12)] and (iii) knee pain [OR=0.34 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.66)]. Conclusion. In first presenters with hip complaints, use of a few history-taking variables might allow better recognition of those at higher odds for incident hip OA within 10 years.Copyright © 2021 Medical Information Center.

This deficiency explains the persistence of freehand placement of external ventricular drains, which has an inherent risk of inaccurate positioning, multiple passes, tract hemorrhage, and injury to adjacent brain parenchyma. Here, the authors introduce and validate a novel image registration and real-time tracking system for frameless stereotactic neuronavigation and catheter placement in the nonimmobilized patient. METHODS Computer vision technology was used to develop an algorithm that performed near-continuous, automatic, and marker-less image registration. The program fuses a subject's preprocedure CT scans to live 3D camera images (Snap-Surface), and patient movement is incorporated by artificial intelligence-driven recalibration (Real-Track). The surface registration error (SRE) and target registration error (TRE) were calculated for 5 cadaveric heads that underwent serial movements (fast and slow velocity roll, pitch, and yaw motions) and several test conditions, such as surgical draping with limited anatomical exposure and differential subject lighting. Six catheters were placed in each cadaveric head (30 total placements) with a simulated sterile technique. Postprocedure CT scans allowed comparison of planned and actual catheter positions for user error calculation. RESULTS Registration was successful for all 5 cadaveric specimens, with an overall mean (+/- standard deviation) SRE of 0.429 +/- 0.108 mm for the catheter placements. Accuracy of TRE was maintained under 1.2 mm throughout specimen movements of low and high velocities of roll, pitch, and yaw, with the slowest recalibration time of 0.23 seconds. There were no statistically significant differences in SRE when the specimens were draped or fully undraped (p = 0.336). Performing registration in a bright versus a dimly lit environment had no statistically significant effect on SRE (p = 0.742 and 0.859, respectively). For the catheter placements, mean TRE was 0.862 +/- 0.322 mm and mean user error (difference between target and actual catheter tip) was 1.674 +/- 1.195 mm. CONCLUSIONS This computer vision-based registration system provided real-time tracking of cadaveric heads with a recalibration time of less than one-quarter of a second with submillimetric accuracy and enabled catheter placements with millimetric accuracy. Using this approach to guide bedside ventriculostomy could reduce complications, improve safety, and be extrapolated to other frameless stereotactic applications in awake, nonimmobilized patients.Copyright © 2022 The authors, CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:09Z,2022-08-24T07:29:09Z,NA,1475-1484,NA,5,136,NA,J.

We construct novel quantitative methods to quantify and understand MOs. Method(s): We applied a nonparametric bilevel spectral analysis to identify MOs, a millihertz (0.004-0.01 Hz) modulation of 5-15 Hz activity in two separate ICU patient cohorts (n = 195 total). We also developed a rigorous measure to quantify MOs strength and spatial expression, which was validated against surrogate noise data. Result(s): Strong or spatially widespread MOs appear in both high clinical suspicion and a general ICU population. In the former, patients with strong or spatially widespread MOs tended to have worse clinical outcomes. Intracranial pressure and heart rate data from one patient provide insight into a potential broader physiological mechanism for MOs. Conclusion(s): We quantified millihertz EEG modulation (MOs) in cohorts of critically ill pediatric patients. We demonstrated high incidence in two patient populations. In a high suspicion cohort, MOs are associated with poor outcome, suggesting future potential as a diagnostic and prognostic aid. Significance: These results support the existence of EEG dynamics across disparate time-scales and may provide insight into brain injury physiology in young children.Copyright © 2022 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:09Z,2022-08-24T07:29:09Z,NA,84-91,NA,"(Loe, Khanmohammadi, Ching) Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, United States",137,NA,Clin.

Method(s): A total of 150 users with chronic diseases who had been staying in a nursing home during the period from January 2020 to March 2021 were enrolled and divided into 2 groups for experiments. The t-test and Bayesian methods were used to establish a generalized linear regression model to evaluate the effect of the IPBS on the quality of life of the subjects in the experiment. The control group (n=71) received routine examination and daily health risk management in pension facilities. Health service workers provided daily door-to-door care, and the users received regular diet, exercise, and medication supervision and guidance. The intervention group (n=79) was composed of users with chronic diseases, who accepted the IPBS. The health service workers, in addition to implementing routine examination and health risk management, conducted continuous monitoring and intervention management of the users' vital signs by means of the IPBS. Result(s): The results obtained with the Bayesian generalized linear regression model tended to agree with those of the t-test analysis. After 15 months of follow-up in the intervention group, the rates of body function, emotion, behavior compliance (BC), and health knowledge (HK) awareness were 1.47 times, 1.75 times, 1.53 times, and 1.69 times higher than those in the control group, respectively. In the intervention group, after using the IPBS, all scores of quality of life were better than those before use, and the differences were statistically significant P=0 or P=0.1 (P<0.05). In the control group, there were no statistically significant differences before and after observation (P>0.05). Conclusion(s): Routine management in elderly users with chronic diseases by means of the IPBS, which could change the users' bad living habits and eating habits, raise the patients' HK awareness, and comprehensively improve the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases, is a self-health management model worthy of application and promotion.Copyright © Annals of Translational Medicine.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:09Z,2022-08-24T07:29:09Z,NA,363,NA,6,10,NA,Ann.

A prospective pilot study was conducted with 33 participants admitted to a long-term care facility between August 10 and 25, 2020. During the pilot study, we collected 560 cases that included 33 clinical variables and the survey items from the short confusion assessment method (S-CAM), and developed a mobile-based application. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including four rule-mining algorithms (C4.5, CBA, MCAR, and LEM2) and four other statistical learning algorithms (LR, ANNs, SVMs with three kernel functions, and random forest), were validated by paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on both macro-averaged F1 and weighted average F1-measures during the 10-times stratified 2-fold cross-validation. The LEM2 algorithm achieved the best prediction performance (macro-averaged F1-measure of 49.35%; weighted average F1-measure of 96.55%), correctly identifying adult patients at delirium risk. In the pairwise comparison between predictive powers observed from independent models, the LEM2 model showed a medium or large effect size between 0.4925 and 0.8766 when compared with LR, ANN, SVM with RBF, and MCAR models. We have confirmed that acute consciousness in S-CAM assessment is closely associated with different predictors for screening three psychomotor behaviors of delirium: 1) education level, dementia type or its level, sleep disorder, dehydration, and infection in mixed-type delirium; 2) gender, education level, dementia type, dehydration, bedsores, and foley catheter in hyperactive delirium; and 3) pain, sleep disorder, and haloperidol use in hypoactive delirium.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:09Z,2022-08-24T07:29:09Z,NA,1802-1814,NA,4,26,NA,IEEE J.

Recent findings Patients with acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) experience dizziness, gait unsteadiness and nausea/vomiting. A variety of causes can lead to this condition, including strokes. These patients cannot be adequately identified with the conventional approach by stratifying based on risk factors and symptom type. In addition to bedside methods such as HINTS and HINTS plus, quantitative methods for recording eye movements using VOG can augment the ability to diagnose and localize the lesion. In particular, the ability to identify and quantify the head impulse test (VOR gain, saccade metrics), nystagmus characteristics (waveform, beating direction and intensity), skew deviation, audiometry and lateropulsion expands our diagnostic capabilities. In addition to telemedicine, algorithms and artificial intelligence can be used to support emergency physicians and nonexperts in the future.

METHOD(S): Computer vision technology was used to develop an algorithm for near continuous, automatic, and marker-less image registration. The program fuses a subject's pre-procedure CT scan to live 3D camera images (Snap-Surface), and movement is incorporated by artificial intelligence driven recalibration (Real-Track). Surface registration error (SRE) and target registration error (TRE) were calculated for five cadaver heads that underwent serial movements (fast and slow velocity roll, pitch, and yaw motions), and several test conditions. Six catheters were placed in each cadaver (30 placements). Post-procedure CT scans allowed comparison of planned and actual catheter position for user error calculation. RESULT(S): Registration was successful for all five cadaveric specimens (average SRE 0.429 mm, +/-0.108). Accuracy of TRE was under 1.2mm throughout specimen movements of low and high velocities of roll, pitch, and yaw movements, with the slowest recalibration time of 0.23 seconds. There were no statistically significant differences in SRE when the specimens were draped or fully undraped (p-value = 0.336). Addition of bright light or performance under dim light did not significantly affect SRE (p-value = 0.742 and 0.859, respectively). Average TRE for catheter placements was 0.862 mm (+/-0.322), and average user error for the was 1.674 mm (+/-1.195). CONCLUSION(S): This computer vision-based registration system provides real-time tracking of cadaveric heads with recalibration time of less than one-quarter of a second with sub-millimetric accuracy, and enabled catheter placements with millimetric accuracy. Using this approach to guide bedside ventriculostomy could reduce complications, improve safety, and could be extrapolated to other frameless stereotactic applications in awake, non-immobilized patients.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:09Z,2022-08-24T07:29:09Z,NA,54,NA,SUPPL 1,68,NA,Clin.

This study evaluated the performance of the smart bed relative to polysomnography (PSG) in estimating epoch-by-epoch HR, BR, sleep vs. wake, mean overnight HR and BR, and summary sleep variables. Forty-five participants (aged 22-64 years; 55% women) slept one night on the smart bed with standard PSG. Smart bed data were compared to PSG by Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson correlation for epoch-by-epoch HR and epoch-by-epoch BR.

In this paper, a bidirectional long short term memory (bi-LSTM) regression network is developed for non-invasive heart rate estimation from the ballistocardiograms (BCG) signals. The proposed deep regression model provides an effective solution to the existing challenges in BCG heart rate estimation, such as the mismatch between the BCG signals and ground-truth reference, multi-sensor fusion and effective time series feature learning. Allowing label uncertainty in the estimation can reduce the manual cost of data annotation while further improving the heart rate estimation performance. Compared with the state-of-the-art BCG heart rate estimation methods, the strong fitting and generalization ability of the proposed deep regression model maintains better robustness to noise (e.g., sensor noise) and perturbations (e.g., body movements) in the BCG signals and provides a more reliable solution for long term heart rate monitoring.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:09Z,2022-08-24T07:29:09Z,NA,3396-3407,NA,9,25,NA,IEEE J.

Among BCG sensing modalities, a hospital bed with multi-channel load-cells could provide robust HR estimation in hospital setups. In this work, we present a novel array processing technique to improve the existing HR estimation algorithm by optimizing the fusion of information from multiple channels. The array processing includes a Gaussian curve to weight the joint probability according to the reference value obtained from the previous inter-beat-interval (IBI) estimations. Additionally, the probability density functions were selected and combined according to their reliability measured by $q$-values. We demonstrate that this array processing significantly reduces the HR estimation error compared to state-of-the-art multi-channel heartbeat detection algorithms in the existing literature. In the best case, the average mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.76 bpm in the supine position was achieved compared to 2.68 bpm and 1.91 bpm for two state-of-the-art methods from the existing literature. Moreover, the lowest error was found in the supine posture (1.76 bpm) and the highest in the lateral posture (3.03 bpm), thus elucidating the postural effects on HR estimation. The IBI estimation capability was also evaluated, with a MAE of 16.66 ms and confidence interval (95%) of 38.98 ms. The results demonstrate that improved HR estimation can be obtained for a bed-based BCG system with the multi-channel data acquisition and processing approach described in this work.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:10Z,2022-08-24T07:29:10Z,NA,3373-3383,NA,9,25,NA,IEEE J.

However, the wireless channel around the human body poses unique challenges such as a high and variable path-loss caused by frequent changes in the relative node positions as well as the surrounding environment. An adaptive wireless body area network (WBAN) scheme is presented that reconfigures the network by learning from body kinematics and biosignals. It has very low overhead since these signals are already captured by the WBAN sensor nodes to support their basic functionality. Periodic channel fluctuations in activities like walking can be exploited by reusing accelerometer data and scheduling packet transmissions at optimal times. Network states can be predicted based on changes in observed biosignals to reconfigure the network parameters in real time. A realistic body channel emulator that evaluates the path-loss for everyday human activities was developed to assess the efficacy of the proposed techniques. Simulation results show up to 41% improvement in packet delivery ratio (PDR) and up to 27% reduction in power consumption by intelligent scheduling at lower transmission power levels. Moreover, experimental results on a custom test-bed demonstrate an average PDR increase of 20% and 18% when using our adaptive EMG-and heart-rate-based transmission power control methods, respectively.

It is diagnosed through an overnight sleep study in a specialized sleep clinic. This setup is expensive and the number of beds and staff are limited, leading to a long waiting time. To enable more patients to be tested, and repeated monitoring for diagnosed patients, portable sleep monitoring devices are being developed. These devices automatically detect sleep apnea events in one or more respiration-related signals. There are multiple methods to measure respiration, with varying levels of signal quality and comfort for the patient. In this study, the potential of using the bio-impedance (bioZ) of the chest as a respiratory surrogate is analyzed. A novel portable device is presented, combined with a two-phase Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning algorithm for automated event detection. The setup is benchmarked using simultaneous recordings of the device and the traditional polysomnography in 25 patients. The results demonstrate that using only the bioZ, an area under the precision-recall curve of 46.9% can be achieved, which is on par with automatic scoring using a polysomnography respiration channel. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 58.4%, 76.2% and 72.8% respectively. This confirms the potential of using the bioZ device and deep learning algorithm for automatically detecting sleep respiration events during the night, in a portable and comfortable setup.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:10Z,2022-08-24T07:29:10Z,NA,2589-2598,NA,9,24,NA,IEEE J.

A human body lying posture (HBLP) monitoring system is essential to reschedule posture change for patients. Video surveillance, the conventional method of HBLP monitoring, suffers from various limitations, such as subject's privacy, and field-of-view obstruction. We propose an autonomous method for classifying the four state-of-the-art HBLPs in healthy adults subjects: supine, prone, left and right lateral, with no sensors or cables attached on the body and no constraints imposed on the subject. Experiments have been conducted on 12 healthy adults (age 27.35 \pm 5.39 years) using a collection of textile pressure sensors embedded in a cover placed under the bed sheet. Histogram of oriented gradients and local binary patterns were extracted and fed to a supervised artificial neural network classification model. The model was trained based on the scaled conjugate gradient backpropagation. A nested cross validation with an exhaustive outer validation loop was performed to validate the classification's generalization performance. A high testing prediction accuracy of 97.9% with a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 97.2% has been interestingly obtained. Prone and supine postures were successfully separated in the classification, in contrast to the majority of previous similar works. We found that using the information of body weight distribution along with the shape and edges contributes to a better classification performance and the ability to separate supine and prone postures. The results are satisfactorily promising toward unobtrusively monitoring posture for ulcer prevention. The method can be used in sleep studies, post-surgical procedures, or applications requiring HBLP identification.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:10Z,2022-08-24T07:29:10Z,NA,101-110,NA,1,24,NA,IEEE J.

Thus, we propose an unobtrusive activity recognition classifier using deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and anonymous binary sensors that are passive infrared motion sensors and door sensors. We employed Aruba annotated open data set that was acquired from a smart home where a voluntary single elderly woman was living inside for eight months. First, ten basic daily activities, namely, Eating, Bed-to-Toilet, Relax, Meal-Preparation, Sleeping, Work, Housekeeping, Wash-Dishes, Enter-Home, and Leave-Home are segmented with different sliding window sizes, and then converted into binary activity images. Next, the activity images are employed as the ground truth for the proposed DCNN model.

We illustrate the capabilities of this approach for early identification of patients at risk of sepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection, using high-frequency (minute-by-minute) physiological data collected from bedside monitors. In our analysis of a cohort of 586 patients, the model obtained from analyzing the output of a previously developed sepsis prediction model resulted in improved outcomes. Specifically, the original model failed to predict 11.76 +/- 4.26% of sepsis patients earlier than Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, commonly used to identify patients at risk for rapid physiological deterioration resulting from sepsis. In contrast, the multi-layer model only failed to predict 3.21 +/- 3.11% of sepsis patients earlier than SIRS. In addition, sepsis patients were predicted on average 204.87 +/- 7.90 minutes earlier than SIRS criteria using the multi-layer model, which can potentially help reduce mortality and morbidity if implemented in the ICU.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:10Z,2022-08-24T07:29:10Z,NA,978-986,NA,3,23,NA,IEEE J.

However, many people are often unaware of their condition. The gold standard for diagnosing sleep apnea is an overnight polysomnography in a dedicated sleep laboratory. Yet, these tests are expensive and beds are limited as trained staff needs to analyze the entire recording. An automated detection method would allow a faster diagnosis and more patients to be analyzed. Most algorithms for automated sleep apnea detection use a set of human-engineered features, potentially missing important sleep apnea markers. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on state-of-the-art deep learning models for automatically extracting features and detecting sleep apnea events in respiratory signals. The algorithm is evaluated on the Sleep-Heart-Health-Study-1 dataset and provides per-epoch sensitivity and specificity scores comparable to the state of the art. Furthermore, when these predictions are mapped to the apnea-hypopnea index, a considerable improvement in per-patient scoring is achieved over conventional methods. This paper presents a powerful aid for trained staff to quickly diagnose sleep apnea.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:10Z,2022-08-24T07:29:10Z,NA,2354-2364,NA,6,23,NA,IEEE J.

Therefore, increased supervision is proposed as a key strategy toward falls prevention. An emerging generation of batteryless, lightweight, and wearable sensors are creating new possibilities for ambulatory monitoring, where the unobtrusive nature of such sensors makes them particularly adapted for monitoring older people. In this study, we investigate the use of a batteryless radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag response to analyze bed-egress movements. We propose a bed-egress movement detection framework that includes a novel sequence learning classifier with a set of features derived from bed-egress motion analysis. We analyzed data from 14 healthy older people (66-86 years old) who wore a wearable embodiment of a batteryless accelerometer integrated RFID sensor platform loosely attached over their clothes at sternum level, and undertook a series of activities including bed-egress in two clinical room settings. The promising results indicate the efficacy of our batteryless bed-egress monitoring framework.Copyright © 2016 IEEE.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:10Z,2022-08-24T07:29:10Z,NA,917-929,NA,4,21,NA,IEEE J.

We studied 3766 patients admitted to the University of Virginia Health System Surgical Trauma Burn ICU. Hemorrhage was defined as three or more units of red blood cells transfused within 24 h without red blood cell transfusion in the preceding 24 h. 222 patients (5.9%) experienced a hemorrhage, and multivariate models based on vital signs and their trends showed good results (AUC = 76.1%). The hematocrit, not surprisingly, had excellent performance (AUC = 87.7%). Models that included both continuous monitoring and laboratory tests had the best performance (AUC = 92.2%).

The existing monitoring systems use sensors attached to the bed or worn by the person.

The performance of the microbend fiber sensor is assessed in two groups of cancer patients, cancer patients with pain and without pain, ranging from eighteen to ninety-six years old in a daily observational measurement with the sensor mattress under the mattress of the clinical bed. All the patients received standard clinical monitoring for evaluating the accuracy of our measurement results. The results of our study showed good consistency in the experimental results of RR and HR between the dual-path fiber sensor we proposed and the hospital equipment with average errors of 3.60 beats per minute (bpm) and 1.02 respiration per minute (rpm) in HR and RR measurement in cancer patients with pain and 1.87bpm and 1.27rpm in HR and RR measurement in cancer patients without pain, respectively. In HR monitoring, the single path microbend fiber optic sensor has 8035 minutes of data with a false report rate of 19.09%, while the dual-path microbend fiber optic sensor has 6188 minutes of data with a false report rate of 12.87%. The dual-path sensor has a smaller false report rate compared with the single path sensor due to pre-judgments of data with path 1 and path 2. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to propose and demonstrate a dual-path sensor to reduce the false report rate for HR and RR measurements. The results of the Blend-Altman method showed great agreement between our sensor and hospital standard monitor in HR and RR measurements. The independent sample t-test indicates that the HR of cancer patients may be an effective way to judge whether or not they have cancer pain. Our noninvasive dual-path microbend fiber sensor also showed the advantages of an easy fabrication process, simple structure, and low false report rate.Copyright © 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:11Z,2022-08-24T07:29:11Z,NA,982-994,NA,2,13,NA,Biomed.

Improving malaria prevention programmes requires understanding usage patterns in households receiving LLINs, but there are limits to what standard cross-sectional surveys of self-reported LLIN use can provide. This study was designed to assess the performance of an accelerometer-based approach for measuring a range of LLIN use behaviours as a proof of concept for more granular LLIN-use monitoring over longer time periods. Method(s): This study was carried out under controlled conditions from May to July 2018 in Liverpool, UK. A single accelerometer was affixed to the side panel of an LLIN and participants carried out five LLIN use behaviours: (1) unfurling a net; (2) entering an unfurled net; (3) lying still as if sleeping; (4) exiting from under a net; and, (5) folding up a net. The randomForest package in R, a supervised non-linear classification algorithm, was used to train models on 20-s epochs of tagged accelerometer data. Models were compared in a validation dataset using overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, receiver operating curves and the area under the curve (AUC). Result(s): The five-category model had overall accuracy of 82.9% in the validation dataset, a sensitivity of 0.681 for entering a net, 0.632 for exiting, 0.733 for net down, and 0.800 for net up. A simplified four-category model, combining entering/exiting a net into one category had accuracy of 94.8%, and increased sensitivity for net down (0.756) and net up (0.829). A further simplified three-category model, identifying sleeping, net up, and a combined net down/enter/exit category had accuracy of 96.2% (483/502), with an AUC of 0.997 for net down and 0.987 for net up. Models for detecting entering/exiting by adults were significantly more accurate than for children (87.8% vs 70.0%; p < 0.001) and had a higher AUC (p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): Understanding how LLINs are used is crucial for planning malaria prevention programmes. Accelerometer-based systems provide a promising new methodology for studying LLIN use. Further work exploring accelerometer placement, frequency of measurements and other machine learning approaches could make these methods even more accurate in the future.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:11Z,2022-08-24T07:29:11Z,NA,85,NA,1,21,NA,Malar.

As an example, when people age one possible condition that they may experience is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). SDB, better known as the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, and associated cardiovascular complications are among the most common clinical disorders. The gold-standard approach to accurately diagnose OSA, is polysomnography (PSG), a test that should be performed in a specialist sleep clinic and requires a complete overnight stay at the clinic. The PSG system can provide accurate and real-time data; however, it introduces several challenges such as complexity, invasiveness, excessive cost, and absence of privacy. Technological advancements in hardware and software enable noninvasive and unobtrusive sensing of vital signs. An alternative approach which may help diagnose OSA and other cardiovascular diseases is the ballistocardiography. The ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal captures the ballistic forces of the heart caused by the sudden ejection of blood into the great vessels with each heartbeat, breathing, and body movement. In recent years, BCG sensors such as polyvinylidene fluoride film-based sensors, electromechanical films, strain Gauges, hydraulic sensors, microbend fiber-optic sensors as well as fiber Bragg grating sensors have been integrated within ambient locations such as mattresses, pillows, chairs, beds, or even weighing scales, to capture BCG signals, and thereby measure vital signs. Analysis of the BCG signal is a challenging process, despite being a more convenient and comfortable method of vital signs monitoring. In practice, BCG sensors are placed under bed mattresses for sleep tracking, and hence several factors, e.g., mattress thickness, body movements, motion artifacts, bed-partners, etc. can deteriorate the signal. In this paper, we introduce the sensors that are being used for obtaining BCG signals. We also present an in-depth review of the signal processing methods as applied to the various sensors, to analyze the BCG signal and extract physiological parameters such heart rate and breathing rate, as well as determining sleep stages. Besides, we recommend which methods are more suitable for processing BCG signals due to their nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics.Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:11Z,2022-08-24T07:29:11Z,NA,10,NA,1,7,NA,Health Inf.

This study aims to develop and verify a real-time, interpretable machine learning model, namely cardiac arrest prediction index (CAPI), to predict CA of critically ill patients based on bedside vital signs monitoring. Method(s): A total of 1,860 patients were analyzed retrospectively from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Based on vital signs, we extracted a total of 43 features for building machine learning model. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) was used to develop a real-time prediction model. Three-fold cross validation determined the consistency of model accuracy. SHAP value was used to capture the overall and real-time interpretability of the model. Result(s): On the test set, CAPI predicted 95% of CA events, 80% of which were identified more than 25 min in advance, resulting in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94. The sensitivity, specificity, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and F1-score were 0.86, 0.85, 0.12 and 0.05, respectively. Conclusion(s): CAPI can help predict patients with CA in the vital signs monitoring at bedside. Compared with previous studies, CAPI can give more timely notifications to doctors for CA events. However, current performance was at the cost of alarm fatigue. Future research is still needed to achieve better clinical application.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2022-08-24T07:29:11Z,2022-08-24T07:29:11Z,NA,106568,NA,"(Yijing, Wenyu, Kang, Shengyu, Xianliang, Xingliang, Cheng, Zehui, Mengxing) Shenzhen Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China",214,NA,Comput.

At the conclusion of each test session, captured cNIBP measurements were extracted using MediCollector BEDSIDE data extraction software, and Vitaliti CVSM measurements were extracted to a secure laptop through a cable connection. The errors of these determinations were calculated. Participants were interviewed about device acceptability. RESULT(S): The validation analysis included data for 20 patients. The average times from calibration to first measurement in the static position and to first measurement in the supine position were 133.85 seconds (2 minutes 14 seconds) and 535.15 seconds (8 minutes 55 seconds), respectively. The overall mean errors of determination for the static position were -0.621 (SD 4.640) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 0.457 (SD 1.675) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Errors of determination were slightly higher for the supine position, at 2.722 (SD 5.207) mm Hg for SBP and 2.650 (SD 3.221) mm Hg for DBP. The majority rated the Vitaliti CVSM as comfortable. This study was limited to evaluation of the device during a very short validation period after calibration (ie, that commenced within 2 minutes after calibration and lasted for a short duration of time). CONCLUSION(S): We found that the Cloud DX's Vitaliti CVSM demonstrated cNIBP measurement in compliance with ISO 81060-2:2018 standards in the context of evaluation that commenced within 2 minutes of device calibration; this device was also well-received by patients in a postsurgical ICU setting. Future studies will examine the accuracy of the Vitaliti CVSM in ambulatory contexts, with attention to assessment over a longer duration and the impact of excessive patient motion on data artifacts and signal quality.

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based resting-state brain network analysis, which could provide an effective evaluation method, remains to be extensively studied. Aim(s): Our study aims to verify the feasibility of fNIRS-based resting-state brain networks for evaluating brain function in infants with HIBD to provide a new and effective means for clinical research in neonatal HIBD. Approach: Thirteen neonates with HIBD were scanned using fNIRS in the resting state. The brain network properties were explored to attempt to extract effective features as recognition indicators. Result(s): Compared with healthy controls, newborns with HIBD showed decreased brain functional connectivity. Specifically, there were severe losses of long-range functional connectivity of the contralateral parietal-Temporal lobe, contralateral parietal-frontal lobe, and contralateral parietal lobe. The node degree showed a widespread decrease in the left frontal middle gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus dorsal, and right central posterior gyrus. However, newborns with HIBD showed a significantly higher local network efficiency (*p < 0.05). Subsequently, network indicators based on small-worldness, local efficiency, modularity, and normalized clustering coefficient were extracted for HIBD identification with the accuracy observed as 79.17%. Conclusion(s): Our findings indicate that fNIRS-based resting-state brain network analysis could support early HIBD diagnosis.Copyright © The Authors.

However, few studies have explained the relationship between risk factors and risk levels using machine learning methods from Braden clinical observation data. Additionally, nearly half of the elderly over 75 years old in China are men. Purpose(s): This study aimed to establish a pressure injury risk prediction model for elderly male patients using a machine learning method based on hospital clinical data. It further analyses the importance of risk factors and risk levels. Method(s): This study's Braden observation data were obtained from the electronic medical records of elderly male patients from 27 October 2019 to 1 November 2020 in the case hospital. Rough set theory was used to identify the perception patterns between risk factors and risk levels based on the data. Result(s): The importance of rough set theory showed that sensory perception and nutrition are key risk factors for identifying elderly male inpatients. Therefore, nurses should pay special attention to the measurement scores of these two risk factors. Moreover, this method also revealed conditions/decision rules for different risk levels. Among elderly male inpatients at risk of severe pressure injury, 42% of the observation data showed that their physical condition is completely limited in sensory perception, possibly insufficient nutrition, friction and shearing problems, and bedridden activities. Conclusion(s): This model can effectively identify the critical risk factors and decision rules for different risk levels for pressure injury in elderly male inpatients. This allows nurses to focus on patients at a high risk of possible pressure injury in the future without increasing their workload. This study also provides a way to solve the problem that the Braden scale shows insufficient predictive validity and poor accuracy in identifying patients with different pressure injury risk levels, so it cannot fully reflect patients' characteristics.Copyright © 2021.

Impulse radio (IR) ultra-wideband (UWB) radar becomes one of the essential sensors in non-contact vital signs detection. The heart pulse wave is easily corrupted by noise and respiration activity since the heartbeat signal has less power compared with the breathing signal and its harmonics. In this paper, a signal processing technique for a UWB radar system was developed to detect the heart rate and respiration rate. There are four main stages of signal processing: (1) clutter removal to reduce the static random noise from the environment; (2) independent component analysis (ICA) to do dimension reduction and remove noise; (3) using low-pass and high-pass filters to eliminate the out of band noise; (4) modified covariance method for spectrum estimation. Furthermore, higher harmonics of heart rate were used to estimate heart rate and minimize respiration interference. The experiments in this article contain different scenarios including bed angle, body position, as well as interference from the visitor near the bed and away from the bed. The results were compared with the ECG sensor and respiration belt.

Early detection and treatment are critical to improving outcomes. Our primary objective was to develop artificial intelligence capable of predicting sepsis earlier using a minimal set of streaming physiological data in real time. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 29,552 adult patients were admitted to the intensive care unit across five regional hospitals in Memphis, Tenn, over 18 months from January 2017 to July 2018. From these, 5,958 patients were selected after filtering for continuous (minute-by-minute) physiological data availability. A total of 617 (10.4%) patients were identified as sepsis cases, using the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) criteria. Physiomarkers, a set of signal processing features, were derived from five physiological data streams including heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean), captured every minute from the bedside monitors. A support vector machine classifier was used for classification. The model accurately predicted sepsis up to a mean and 95% confidence interval of 17.4 +/- 0.22 h before sepsis onset, with an average test accuracy of 83.0% (average sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.757, 0.902, and 0.781, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): This study demonstrates that salient physiomarkers derived from continuous bedside monitoring are temporally and differentially expressed in septic patients. Using this information, minimalistic artificial intelligence models can be developed to predict sepsis earlier in critically ill patients.Copyright © 2020 by the Shock Society.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:12Z,2022-08-24T07:29:12Z,NA,58-64,NA,1,56,NA,Shock,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=633078382,*artificial intelligence; *pathophysiology; aged; critical illness; female; human; male; middle aged; prognosis; retrospective study; sepsis; time factor,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Internet of Things (IoT) technologies provides new ways to remotely monitor patients within the comfort of their homes, particularly important for the timely delivery of appropriate healthcare. Presented here is data collated as part of the on-going UK Dementia Research Institute's Care Research and Technology Centre cohort and Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM) study. There are two main aims to this work: first, to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 quarantine on the performance of daily living activities of PLWD, on which there is currently little research; and second, to create a simple classification model capable of effectively predicting agitation risk in PLWD, allowing for the generation of alerts with actionable information by which to prevent such outcomes. METHOD(S): A within-subject, date-matched study was conducted on daily living activity data using the first COVID-19 quarantine as a natural experiment. Supervised machine learning approaches were then applied to combined physiological and environmental data to create two simple classification models: a single marker model trained using ambient temperature as a feature, and a multi-marker model using ambient temperature, body temperature, movement, and entropy as features. RESULT(S): There are 102 PLWD total included in the dataset, with all patients having an established diagnosis of dementia, but with ranging types and severity. The COVID-19 study was carried out on a sub-group of 21 patient households. In 2020, PLWD had a significant increase in daily household activity (p = 1.40e-08), one-way repeated measures ANOVA). Moreover, there was a significant interaction between the pandemic quarantine and patient gender on night-time bed-occupancy duration (p = 3.00e-02, two-way mixed-effect ANOVA). On evaluating the models using 10-fold cross validation, both the single and multi-marker model were shown to balance precision and recall well, having F1-scores of 0.80 and 0.66, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Remote monitoring technologies provide a continuous and reliable way of monitoring patient day-to-day wellbeing. The application of statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms to combined physiological and environmental data has huge potential to positively impact the delivery of healthcare for PLWD.Copyright © 2021 the Alzheimer's Association.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:12Z,2022-08-24T07:29:12Z,NA,e058614,NA,Supplement 12,17,NA,Alzheimers Dement,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emexa&NEWS=N&AN=636972758,*agitation; *algorithm; *daily life activity; *dementia; *home monitoring; *prediction; adult; analysis of variance; article; body temperature; clinical article; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cross validation; entropy; environmental temperature; female; gender; hospital bed utilization; household; human; male; night; pandemic; quarantine; recall; remote sensing; supervised machine learning; validation process; wellbeing,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In an aged care facility, it is crucial to monitor elderly patients and assist them in the case of falls or other needs. Wearable devices can be used for such a purpose. However, most of them have been proven to be obtrusive, and patients reluctate or forget to wear them. In this study, we used infrared technology to recognize certain human activities including sitting, standing, walking, laying in bed, laying down, and falling. We evaluated a system consisting of two 24x32 thermal array sensors. One infrared sensor was installed on side and another one was installed on the ceiling of an experimental room capturing the same scene. We chose side and overhead mounts to compare the performance of classifiers. We used our prototypes to collect data from healthy young volunteers while performing eight different scenarios. After that, we converted data coming from the sensors into images and applied a supervised deep learning approach. The scene was captured by a visible camera and the video from the visible camera was used as the ground truth. The deep learning network consisted of a convolutional neural network which automatically extracted features from infrared images. Overall average F1-score of all classes for the side mount was 0.9044 and for the overhead mount was 0.8893.

Annual International Conference,NA,2694-0604 (electronic),10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629643,NA,"A non-contact bedside monitoring system using medical radar is expected to be applied to clinical fields. Our previous studies have developed a monitoring system based on medical radar for measuring respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR). Heart rate variability (HRV), which is essentially implemented in advanced monitoring system, such as prognosis prediction, is a more challenging biological information than the RR and HR. In this study, we designed a HRV measurement filter and proposed a method to evaluate the optimal cardiac signal extraction filter for HRV measurement. Because the cardiac component in the radar signal is much smaller than the respiratory component, it is necessary to extract the cardiac element from the radar output signal using digital filters. It depends on the characteristics of the filter whether the HRV information is kept in the extracted cardiac signal or not. A cardiac signal extraction filter that is not distorted in the time domain and does not miss the cardiac component must be adopted. Therefore, we focused on evaluating the interval between the R-peak of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the radar-cardio peak of the cardiac signal measured by radar (R-radar interval). This is based on the fact that the time between heart depolarization and ventricular contraction is measured as the R-radar interval. A band-pass filter (BPF) with several bandwidths and a nonlinear filter, locally projective adaptive signal separation (LoPASS), were analyzed and compared. The optimal filter was quantitatively evaluated by analyzing the distribution and standard deviation of the R-radar intervals.

Recent advances in video analytics for patient monitoring provide a non-intrusive avenue to reduce this risk through continuous activity monitoring.

The majority of prior studies have focused on fall event detection, and do not consider the circumstances that may indicate an imminent inpatient fall. Here, we propose a video-based system that can monitor the risk of a patient falling, and alert staff of unsafe behaviour to help prevent falls before they occur. We propose an approach that leverages recent advances in human localisation and skeleton pose estimation to extract spatial features from video frames recorded in a simulated environment. We demonstrate that body positions can be effectively recognised and provide useful evidence for fall risk assessment.

We present and evaluate a novel method for the manual annotation of in-bed periods in accelerometer data using the open-source software Audacity, and we compare the method to the EEG-based sleep monitoring device Zmachine Insight+ and self-reported sleep diaries. For evaluating the manual annotation method, we calculated the inter- and intra-rater agreement and agreement with Zmachine and sleep diaries using interclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. Our results showed excellent inter- and intra-rater agreement and excellent agreement with Zmachine and sleep diaries. The Bland-Altman limits of agreement were generally around +/-30 min for the comparison between the manual annotation and the Zmachine timestamps for the in-bed period.

For a variety of reasons (objective measure in small children, who cannot communicate verbally; intubation; neuromuscular blockade), heart rate (HR) is often used to assess medication response. As a groundwork for decision support, we created a model of predicting a favorable hemodynamic response to intravenous morphine. Method(s): All doses of intravenous morphine administered to patients in the cardiac ICU between 2011 and 2020 were reviewed, excluding doses given on ECMO support, during pacing, or with missing hemodynamic data. The change in HR Z score from baseline (5 minutes prior to bolus) and putative peak effect (30 minutes post-bolus) was computed. Doses were dichotomized into 'effective' doses (HR decrease by >=1 Z-score) and 'ineffective', denoting a particularly noticeable change at the bedside. Generalized mixed linear models (GMLM) and random forest (RF) classifiers were used to model the HR response over time. The dataset was divided (dose level) into training (80%) and validation (20%) cohorts. Result(s): Of 197,242 doses, 117,495 doses among 8,154 patients (median age 0.61 years, 44% post-surgical patients) were included. The median dose of morphine was 0.051 mg/kg (IQR 0.048, 0.099). Concomitant infusions included opioids (45%) and sedatives (53%); 23% of patients received NMB agents. The median HR Z score change was-0.8 (A). HR response category was well predicted by both GMLM (sensitivity = 0.69, PPV 0.90, AUC 0.74) and RF models (sensitivity = 0.73, PPV = 0.90, AUC = 0.76). Predictor variables for GMLM are shown in B. Conclusion(s): A favorable HR response to morphine can be accurately predicted prior to administration using logical patient factors.

PTSD is highly co-occurring with alcohol use disorder. Only some individuals experiencing traumatic stress develop PTSD and a subset of individuals with PTSD develop co-occurring alcohol use disorder. To investigate the basis of these individual responses to traumatic stress, single prolonged stress (SPS) a rodent model of traumatic stress was applied to young adult female rats. Individual responses to SPS were characterized by measuring anxiety-like behaviors with open field and elevated plus maze tests. Rats were then allowed to drink ethanol under an intermittent two bottle choice procedure for 8 weeks, and ethanol consumption was measured. An artificial intelligence algorithm was built to predict resilient and vulnerable individuals based on data from anxiety testing and ethanol consumption. This model was implemented in a second cohort of rats that underwent SPS without ethanol drinking to identify resilient and vulnerable individuals for further study. Analysis of neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels and expression of its receptors Y1R and Y2R mRNA in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and bed nucleus stria terminalis (BNST) were performed. Results demonstrate that resilient rats had higher expression of Y2R mRNA in the CeA compared with vulnerable and control rats and had higher levels of NPY protein in the BNST compared to controls. The results of the study show that an artificial intelligence algorithm can identify individual differences in response to traumatic stress which can be used to predict subsequent ethanol drinking, and the NPY pathway is differentially altered following traumatic stress exposure in resilient and vulnerable populations. Understanding neurochemical alterations following traumatic-stress exposure is critical in developing prevention strategies for the vulnerable phenotype and will help further development of novel therapeutic approaches for individuals suffering from PTSD and at risk for alcohol use disorder.Copyright © 2021 Denny, Connelly, Ghilotti, Meissler, Yu, Eisenstein and Unterwald.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:13Z,2022-08-24T07:29:13Z,NA,772946,NA,"(Denny, Connelly, Ghilotti, Meissler, Eisenstein, Unterwald) Center for Substance Abuse Research, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, United States",15,NA,Front.

While historically recorded manually, bedside monitors now provide for the automated collection of such data. Despite the availability of continuous streaming data, patients' charts continue to reflect only a subset of this information as snapshots recorded throughout a hospitalization. Over the past decade, prominent works have explored the implications of such practices and established fundamental differences in the alignment of discrete charted vitals and steaming data captured by monitoring systems. Limited work has examined the temporal properties of these differences, how they manifest, and their relation to clinical applications. The work presented in this article addresses this disparity, providing evidence that differences between charting techniques extend to measures of variability. Our results demonstrate how variability manifests with respect to temporal elements of charting timing and how it can facilitate personalized care by contextualizing deviations in magnitude. This work also highlights the utility of variability metrics with relation to clinical measures including associations to severity scores and a case study utilizing complex variability metrics derived from the complete set of monitor data.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Parental questionnaires provided information about family characteristics and children's EBRBs for 978 5-year-olds of the EDEN cohort. We used principal component analysis to derive lifestyle patterns from EBRBs and hierarchical multivariable linear regressions to assess their associations with family socio-demographics, parent health/behaviors, and parent-child interactions. Analyses were stratified by sex. Of the three lifestyle patterns identified (unhealthy, healthy, and mixed), the mixed pattern differed the most between sexes. Lower parental education, suboptimal maternal diet, TV during meals, and later bedtime were associated with higher adherence to unhealthy patterns. Children cognitively stimulated at home and boys of mothers not employed adhered more to the healthy pattern. Older siblings (for girls) and higher engagement of parents in leisure-time physical activity (for boys) were related to greater adherence to mixed patterns. The identification of various correlates from multiple socioecological levels suggests that tackling the potentially synergistic effect of lifestyle patterns on health requires addressing processes relevant to the parent-child dimension and structural barriers parents may encounter.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Compared with the feature images extracted by traditional methods, the behavioral features extracted in this paper are related to the individual menopausal women and have better semantic information, and the feature description ability in the time domain and the space domain has been enhanced. Through Matlab software, using the database established in this paper to compare its feature extraction time, test classification time, and final recognition accuracy with ordinary convolutional neural networks, it is concluded that the cross-layer CNN-SVM model can ensure the speed of feature extraction. It proves that the method in this paper can be applied to the behavioral intelligent diagnosis system for intelligently nursing menopausal women and has good practical value. This paper designs a home care bed intelligent monitoring system, which can automatically detect the posture of the care bed, and not only can change the posture of the bed under the control of personnel, but also can automatically complete the posture conversion according to the setting. At the same time, the system has the function of monitoring the physical condition of the person being cared for and can detect the heart rate, blood oxygen, and other physiological indicators of the bedridden person. In addition, the system can also provide a remote diagnosis function, allowing nursing staff to remotely view the current state of the nursing bed and the physical condition of the person. After testing, the system works stably, improves the automation and safety of the nursing bed control, and enriches the functions of the nursing bed.Copyright © 2021 Qing Chao et al.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:13Z,2022-08-24T07:29:13Z,NA,4963361,NA,"(Chao, Peng) First Affiliated Hospital of xi'An Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, Xi'an 710061, China",2021,NA,J.

Automation of hospital beds using advanced robotics and sensors has been a growing trend exacerbated by the COVID crisis. In this exploratory study, a polynomial regression (PR) machine learning (ML) RAM algorithm based on a Dreyfusian descriptor for immediate wellbeing monitoring was proposed for the autonomous hospital bed transport (AHBT) application. This method was preferred over several other AI algorithm for its simplicity and quick computation. The algorithm quantified historical data using supervised photoplethysmography (PPG) data for 5 min just before the start of the autonomous journey, referred as pre-journey (PJ) dataset. During the transport process, the algorithm continued to quantify immediate measurements using non-overlapping sets of 30 PPG waveforms, referred as in-journey (IJ) dataset. In combination, this algorithm provided a binary decision condition that determined if AHBT should continue its journey to destination by checking the degree of polynomial (DoP) between PJ and IJ. Wrist PPG was used as algorithm's monitoring parameter. PPG data was collected simultaneously from both wrists of 35 subjects, aged 21 and above in postures mimicking that in AHBT and were given full freedom of upper limb and wrist movement. It was observed that the top goodness-of-fit which indicated potentials for high data accountability had 0.2 to 0.6 cross validation score mean (CVSM) occurring at 8th to 10th DoP for PJ datasets and 0.967 to 0.994 CVSM at 9th to 10th DoP for IJ datasets. CVSM was a reliable metric to pick out the best PJ and IJ DoPs. Central tendency analysis showed that coinciding DoP distributions between PJ and IJ datasets, peaking at 8th DoP, was the precursor to high algorithm stability. Mean algorithm efficacy was 0.20 as our proposed algorithm was able to pick out all signals from a conscious subject having full freedom of movement. This efficacy was acceptable as a first ML proof of concept for AHBT.

We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of adult patients at the Mount Sinai Hospital, an academic medical center in New York City. All patients presenting to our institutional ED between January 2014 and December 2018 were included. Structured (tabular) demographic, clinical, bed movement record data, and free text data from triage notes were extracted from our institutional data warehouse.

The eNightLog system consisted of remote sensors, including a near infra-red 3D time-of-flight sensor and ultrawideband sensors. An alarm system was controlled by customized software and algorithm based on the respiration rate and body posture of the elderly. The performance of the eNightLog system was evaluated in both single and double bed settings by comparing to that of a pressure mat and an infrared fence system, under simulated bed-exiting scenarios. The accuracy and precision for the three systems were 99.0%, 98.8%, 85.9% and 99.2%, 97.8%, 78.6%, respectively. With higher accuracy, precision, and a lower false alarm rate, eNightLog demonstrated its potential as an alternative to physical restraint to remedy the workload of the caregivers and the psychological impact of the elderly.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:13Z,2022-08-24T07:29:13Z,NA,NA,NA,3,21,NA,Sensors (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Switzerland Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=634121149,*physiologic monitoring; *wandering behavior; aged; caregiver; falling; human; independent living,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A rapid and accurate heart rate measurement is vital during the first minutes after birth. Clinical recommendations suggest that electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring should be widely adopted in the neonatal intensive care unit to reduce infant mortality and improve long term health outcomes in births that require intervention. Novel non-contact electrocardiogram sensors can reduce the time from birth to heart rate reading as well as providing unobtrusive and continuous monitoring during intervention. In this work we report the design and development of a solution to provide high resolution, real time electrocardiogram data to the clinicians within the delivery room using non-contact electric potential sensors embedded in a neonatal intensive care unit mattress. A real-time high-resolution electrocardiogram acquisition solution based on a low power embedded system was developed and textile embedded electrodes were fabricated and characterised. Proof of concept tests were carried out on simulated and human cardiac signals, producing electrocardiograms suitable for the calculation of heart rate having an accuracy within +/-1 beat per minute using a test ECG signal, ECG recordings from a human volunteer with a correlation coefficient of ~ 87% proved accurate beat to beat morphology reproduction of the waveform without morphological alterations and a time from application to heart rate display below 6 s. This provides evidence that flexible non-contact textile-based electrodes can be embedded in wearable devices for assisting births through heart rate monitoring and serves as a proof of concept for a complete neonate electrocardiogram monitoring system.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:13Z,2022-08-24T07:29:13Z,NA,NA,NA,3,21,NA,Sensors (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Switzerland Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=634205030,*bed; *electrocardiography; *electronic device; *physiologic monitoring; electrode; human; newborn; textile,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A two-phase staggered pulse repetition interval (PRI) solution is introduced to the FMCW radar system. It is implemented as a time-varying MTI filter using twice the hardware resources as compared to a uniform PRI MTI filter. The two-phase staggered PRI FMCW waveform is still periodic with a little more than twice the period of the uniform PRI radar. We also propose a slow time signal integration scheme for the radar detector using the post-fast Fourier transformation Doppler tracking loop. This scheme introduces 4.77 dB of extra signal processing gain to the signal before the radar detector compared with the original uniform PRI FMCW radar. The validation of the algorithm is done on the field programmable logic array in the loop test bed, which accurately models and emulates the target movement, line of sight propagation and radar signal processing. A simulation run of tracking 16 s of the target movement near or at the radar blind speed shows that the total degradation from the raw post-fast Fourier transformation received signal to noise ratio is about 2 dB. With a 20 dB post-processing signal to noise ratio of the proposed algorithm for the moving target at around a 20 km range and with about a -3.5 dB m2 radar cross section at a 1.5 GHz carrier frequency, the tracking errors of the two-dimensional angles with a 4x4 digital phased array are less than 0.2 degree.

In the bedside examination of dizziness and vertigo, nystagmus is the most sensitive and specific sign of vestibular lesions. The measurement of nystagmus pattern by infrared video goggle collected in clinic can provide a valuable diagnostic information for dizziness and vertigo. This paper mainly studies the automatic detection of torsional BPPV nystagmus based on deep learning, thus assisting clinicians diagnose dizziness and vertigo conveniently. In order to eliminate the invalid frames from the blinking of patients under observation, a convolutional neural network(ConvNet) based eye movement video condensation approach is proposed. When calibrating the moving pupil in the captured frame sequence, the Hough transform and trajectory tracking based on template matching are well combined to improve the robustness to eyelash occlusion and pupil deformation. In addition, the optical flow field of moving eyeball is exploited to characterize the torsion motion of torsional nystagmus, based on which a Torsion-aware Bi-Stream Identification Network (TBSIN) model is proposed. Furthermore, through label-error correction based on temporal consistency, we can merge multiple continuous torsional frames into torsional nystagmus segments for clinical diagnosis. Experiments are conducted on a clinically collected torsional nystagmus video dataset and promising experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In particular, we achieve 85.73% and 81.00% in view of Accuracy and F1 measurements for frame-level identification, as well as IOU performance 67.45% for final torsional nystagmus segment localization.Copyright © 2021",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:13Z,2022-08-24T07:29:13Z,NA,102616,NA,"(Zhang, Liu, Zheng, Liu, Li, Zhao, Zhu) Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China",68,NA,Biomed.

Method(s): Data of three groups of adult people with epilepsy (PwE) were analyzed. Group 1 underwent VEEG with additional devices (accelerometry, ECG, electrodermal activity); group 2 underwent VEEG; and group 3 underwent mobile EEG recordings both including one-lead ECG. All seizure types were analyzed. Feature extraction and machine-learning techniques were applied to develop seizure detection algorithms. Performance was expressed as sensitivity, precision, F1 score, and false positives per 24 hours. Result(s): The algorithms were developed in group 1 (35 PwE, 33 seizures) and achieved best results (F1 score 56%, sensitivity 67%, precision 45%, false positives 0.7/24 hours) when ECG features alone were used, with no improvement by including accelerometry and electrodermal activity. In group 2 (97 PwE, 255 seizures), this ECG-based algorithm largely achieved the same performance (F1 score 51%, sensitivity 39%, precision 73%, false positives 0.4/24 hours). In group 3 (30 PwE, 51 seizures), the same ECG-based algorithm failed to meet up with the performance in groups 1 and 2 (F1 score 27%, sensitivity 31%, precision 23%, false positives 1.2/24 hours). ECG-based algorithms were also separately trained on data of groups 2 and 3 and tested on the data of the other groups, yielding maximal F1 scores between 8% and 26%. Significance: Our results suggest that algorithms based on ECG features alone can provide clinically meaningful performance for automatic detection of all seizure types. Our study also underscores that the circumstances under which such algorithms were developed, and the selection of the training and test data sets need to be considered and limit the application of such systems to unseen patient groups behaving in different conditions.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

This public health issue continues to impose strain on clinical healthcare, such as the need to prevent terminal patients' pressure ulcers. Provocative approaches to resolve this issue include health information technology (HIT). In this regard, this paper explores one technological solution based on a smart medical bed (SMB). By integrating a convolutional neural network (CNN) and longshort term memory (LSTM) model, we found this model enhanced performance compared to prior solutions. Further, we provide a fuzzy inferred solution that can control our proposed proprietary automated SMB layout to optimize patients' posture and mitigate pressure ulcers. Therefore, our proposed SMB can allow autonomous care to be given, helping prevent medical complications when lying down for a long time. Our proposed SMB also helps reduce the burden on primary caregivers in fighting against staff shortages due to public health issues such as the increasing aging population.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

It is known that sleep is a key feature of human circadian rhythm but the relation between sleep and female fertility is largely unknown. This paucity of research is surprising given that circadian rhythms are paramount to human physiology and sleep is related to major female reproductive events. This study was designed to investigate whether there is a difference between the sleep and activity parameters of women with poor reproductive outcome compared with healthy, fertile parous women (comparator group) using subjective (questionnaires) and objective (actigraphy and light exposure) measures. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective cohort study in a tertiary in vitro fertilization referral center in the UK; composed of three study groups: women diagnosed with recurrent implantation failure, women with recurrent miscarriage (RM) and a comparison group (fertile women without endometrial pathology). Comparison women were selected gynecology patients without endometrial disease (ie perineal complaints or altruistic egg donors). Primary outcome was differences in objective length of sleep in each of the participant groups using actigraphy. Secondary outcomes were subjective sleep quality and quantity, using participant questionnaires, light exposure, and the feasibility of machine learning in activity-pattern interpretation. Result(s): Women with recurrent implantation failure slept daily on average for 7 hours 35 minutes (+/- 57 min), 53 minutes less than the comparison group (P =.03), although quality of their objective sleep, and quantity of their subjective sleep, were not significantly different. Women with recurrent miscarriage slept less that the comparison women (36 minutes less/night) but more than women with recurrent implantation failure (17 minutes more/night). No difference in light exposure was found between recurrent miscarriage and the recurrent implantation failure and comparison groups. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates an objective observation of sleep time reduction in women with subfertility, although it is not yet clear if this association is casual. Given our increased understanding of the internal body clock and circadian rhythm on fertility, our observation warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2020 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:14Z,2022-08-24T07:29:14Z,NA,302-313,NA,2,100,NA,Acta Obstet.

Repetitive exposures to acute or prolonged pain lead to clinical instability, with long-term behavioural and cognitive sequelae in newborn infants. Strong analgesics are also associated with medical complications, potential neurotoxicity and altered brain development. Pain scores performed by bedside nurses provide subjective, observer-dependent assessments rather than objective data for infant pain management; the required observations are labour intensive, difficult to perform by a nurse who is concurrently performing the procedure and increase the nursing workload. Multimodal pain assessment, using sensor-fusion and machine-learning algorithms, can provide a patient-centred, context-dependent, observer-independent and objective pain measure. Methods and analysis In newborns undergoing painful procedures, we use facial electromyography to record facial muscle activity-related infant pain, ECG to examine heart rate (HR) changes and HR variability, electrodermal activity (skin conductance) to measure catecholamine-induced palmar sweating, changes in oxygen saturations and skin perfusion, and electroencephalography using active electrodes to assess brain activity in real time. This multimodal approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of pain assessment in non-verbal infants and may even allow continuous pain monitoring at the bedside. The feasibility of this approach will be evaluated in an observational prospective study of clinically required painful procedures in 60 preterm and term newborns, and infants aged 6 months or less. Ethics and dissemination The Institutional Review Board of the Stanford University approved the protocol. Study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at scientific meetings, taught via webinars, podcasts and video tutorials, and listed on academic/scientific websites. Future studies will validate and refine this approach using the minimum number of sensors required to assess neonatal/infant pain.

In the day preceding diagnosis, the infant had an increase in oxygen requirement, a heart rate increase, and a rise in a displayed continuous sepsis risk score. These changes were noted but attributed to other interventions and events that had occurred during the day. Later, the nurse paged the team to the bedside when the infant developed tachycardia, hypotension, and diffuse purpura. The team ordered a blood culture and antibiotics, but it was too late. In the modern era of advanced medical analytics and monitoring, it might seem unlikely for bacteremia to slip by undetected until it presents as fulminant sepsis with multiple organ failure. Even the most sophisticated analytics and monitoring systems cannot function without a clinical eye, which can be impeded by intangible barriers, particularly in pediatrics. Recent attention in research has shifted to new mathematical approaches leading to the growth of artificial intelligence within the health system, but less consideration has been placed on the clinician and system requirements needed to promote adoption and integration in practice successfully. In this perspective piece, we first describe the challenges associated with early detection of deterioration using predictive analytics in hospitalized infants, summarized in Table 1 by using the acronym BARRIERS: Babies, Analytics, Reactors, Reassurance, Integration, Equipment, Reeducation, and Space. Table 1 highlights and synopsizes concepts detailed in the body of this article, including, for example, the unique challenge of recognizing illness in infants or nonverbal children that forces clinicians to rely more heavily on monitoring, the gaps between the development of analytics and their pragmatic implementation, and the human and environmental factors that create a rift between the intendedand actual use of early warning scores. Second, we offer strategies to enhance the integration of early warning systems and predictive analytics.Copyright © 2021 American Academy of Pediatrics.

Objective(s): The objective of this study is to develop and validate a real-time computer algorithm that can automatically recognize physiological precursors of cardiorespiratory deterioration in children with single-ventricle physiology during their interstage hospitalization. Method(s): A retrospective study was conducted from prospectively collected physiological data of subjects with single-ventricle physiology. Deterioration events were defined as a cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation or an unplanned intubation. Physiological metrics were derived from the electrocardiogram (heart rate, heart rate variability, ST-segment elevation, and ST-segment variability) and the photoplethysmogram (peripheral oxygen saturation and pleth variability index). A logistic regression model was trained to separate the physiological dynamics of the pre-deterioration phase from all other data generated by study subjects. Data were split 50/50 into model training and validation sets to enable independent model validation. Result(s): Our cohort consisted of 238 subjects admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit and stepdown units of Texas Children's Hospital over a period of 6 years. Approximately 300,000 h of high-resolution physiological waveform and vital sign data were collected using the Sickbay software platform (Medical Informatics Corp., Houston, Texas). A total of 112 cardiorespiratory deterioration events were observed. Seventy-two of the subjects experienced at least 1 deterioration event. The risk index metric generated by our optimized algorithm was found to be both sensitive and specific for detecting impending events 1 to 2 h in advance of overt extremis (receiver-operating characteristic curve area: 0.958; 95% confidence interval: 0.950 to 0.965).

An inability to lie down due to environmental insecurities or pain results in REM sleep deficiency, which can cause substantial impairment of welfare and health. Therefore, the present study used wearable automated sensor technology on 83 horses housed in an animal sanctuary to measure and compare the recumbency, locomotion, and standing time budgets of geriatric horses with and without chronic lameness to younger adult sound and lame horses. Recumbency times ranged from 0 to 319 min per day with an overall mean of 67.4 (+/-61.9) minutes; the time budget for locomotion was 19.1% (+/-11.2% s.d.) and for standing 75.6% (+/-13.1 s.d.). Interestingly, neither age nor lameness due to chronic orthopedic disease had a significant influence on recumbency times in this study. Eight horses showed symptoms of REM deficit. These horses had significantly shorter lying times (7.99 +/- 11.4 min) and smaller locomotion time budgets than the other horses enrolled in this study (73.8 +/- 61.8 min), indicating a general compromise of well-being. Thus, wearable sensor technology can be used to identify horses with low recumbency times at risk for REM sleep deficiency and to assess and monitor equine welfare objectively.Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

Method(s): As part of a larger algorithm, we trained a Residual Deep Neural Network on expert human annotations of EEG recordings from 79 term infants recorded in a neonatal intensive care unit (112 h of 18-channel recording). The network was trained using 10 fold cross validation in Matlab. Artefact types included: device interference, EMG, movement, electrode pop, and non-cortical biological rhythms. Performance was assessed by prediction statistics and further validated on a separate independent dataset of 13 term infants (143 h of 3-channel recording). EEG pre-processing steps, and other post-processing steps such as averaging probability over a temporal window, were also included in the algorithm. Result(s): The Residual Deep Neural Network showed high accuracy (95%) when distinguishing periods of clean, artefact-free EEG from any kind of artefact, with a median accuracy for individual patient of 91% (IQR: 81%-96%). The accuracy in identifying the five different types of artefacts ranged from 57%-92%, with electrode pop being the hardest to detect and EMG being the easiest. This reflected the proportion of artefact available in the training dataset. Misclassification as clean was low for each artefact type, ranging from 1%-11%. The detection accuracy was lower on the validation set (87%). We used the algorithm to show that EEG channels located near the vertex were the least susceptible to artefact. Conclusion(s): Artefacts can be accurately and reliably identified in the neonatal EEG using a deep learning algorithm. Artefact detection algorithms can provide continuous bedside quality assessment and support EEG review by clinicians or analysis algorithms.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:14Z,2022-08-24T07:29:14Z,NA,106194,NA,"(Webb, Roberts, Stevenson) Brain Modelling Group, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, 300 Herston Road, Brisbane, Herston, Australia",208,NA,Comput.

The risk of falls in patients without hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is unclear. Further, bedside tools for predicting falls are lacking. Thus, we aimed to internally validate a predictive model for falls and evaluate the association between incident falls and mortality. Method(s): We prospectively enrolled 299 patients with currently compensated Child A-B (70% Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis and portal hypertension without prior HE from 7/2016-8/2018. We followed patients for a median of 1,003 days (IQR 640-1,102) for incident falls accounting for the competing risk of death or transplantation. Candidate baseline fall predictors included patient-reported outcomes (e.g. Short-Form-8), physical function (e.g. chair-stands), blood tests (e.g. model for end-stage liver disease-sodium [MELD-Na] and its components), and cognitive function (using inhibitory control testing). Result(s): During follow-up: 141 (47%) patients experienced falls, with 38 (13%) sustaining injuries, 49 (16%) died and 13 (4%) received transplants. Median time to a fall was 279 (98-595) days. The overall probability of falls was 28.8% and 50.2% at years 1 and 3; the probability of injurious falls was 9.1% and 16.5%, respectively. We derived a predictive model for falls. The FallSSS score (prior falls, chair-stands, sodium, and SF-8) had an AUROC for injurious falls at 6- and 12-months of 0.79 and 0.81, while MELD-Na's AUROC was 0.57 for both. Adjusting for baseline Child-Pugh class, MELD-Na, albumin level, disability status, and comorbidities, both incident falls (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] 2.76; 95% CI 1.46-5.24) and HE (sHR 4.25; 95% CI 2.15-8.41) were strongly and independently associated with mortality. Conclusion(s): Our prospective study of patients with cirrhosis without a baseline history of HE demonstrates that falls are common, morbid, and predictable. These data highlight both the value of expanding screening to patients with cirrhosis and the potential for benefit in studies of interventions to address fall-risk in this vulnerable population. Lay summary: Falls are a devastating complication of cirrhosis. Bedside tools for predicting falls are lacking. We found that falls were very common and often associated with serious injuries. Falls were also associated with an increased risk of death. Falls could be predicted with an algorithm called FallSSS - based on prior history of falls, blood sodium level, number of chair-stands performed in 30 seconds, and quality of life.Copyright © 2021 European Association for the Study of the Liver",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:14Z,2022-08-24T07:29:14Z,NA,582-588,NA,3,75,NA,J.

First, we attempted to understand the association between the COVID-19 transmission rate, environmental factors (air pollution, weather, mobility), and socio-political parameters (Government Stringency Index, GSI). Second, we evaluated the efficiency of various strategies, including radical opening, intermittent lockdown, phase lift, and contact tracing, to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and get back to pre-pandemic conditions using a stochastic individual-based epidemiology model. Third, we used a deep learning approach and simulated the vaccination rate and the time for reaching herd immunity. The analysis was done based on the collected data from eight countries in Asia, including Iran, Turkey, India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, South Korea, and Russia (as a transcontinental country). Our findings in the first part highlighted a noninfluential impact from the weather-driven parameters and short-term exposure to pollutants on the transmission rate; however, long-term exposure could potentially increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality rates (based on 1998-2017 p.m.2.5 data). Mobility was highly correlated with the COVID-19 transmission and based on our causal analysis reducing mobility could curb the COVID-19 transmission rate with a 6-day lag time (on average). Secondly, among all the tested policies for exiting the COVID-19 pandemic, the contact tracing was the most efficient if executed correctly. With a 2-day delay in tracing the virus hosts, a 60% successful host tracing, and a 70% contact reduction with the hosts, a pandemic will end in a year without overburdening a healthcare system with 6000 hospital beds capacity per million. Lastly, our vaccine simulations showed that the target date for achieving herd immunity significantly varied among the countries and could be delayed to October-november 2022 in countries like India and Iran (based on 60% immunized population and assuming no intermediate factors affecting the vaccination rate).Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:14Z,2022-08-24T07:29:14Z,NA,111657,NA,"(Baniasad) Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, United States",202,NA,Environ.

Nevertheless, nonuniform decreases in muscle mass and function have been frequently reported, and peripheral nerve adaptations have been poorly studied, although some of these mechanisms may be explained. Ten young healthy males (18-33 yr) underwent 10 days of horizontal bed rest. Peripheral neurophysiological assessments were performed bilaterally for the dominant (DL) and nondominant upper and lower limbs (N-DL) on the 1st and 10th day of bed rest, including ultrasound of the median, deep peroneal nerve (DPN), and common fibular nerve (CFN), as well as a complete nerve conduction study (NCS) of the upper and lower limbs. Consistently, reduced F waves, suggesting peripheral nerve dysfunction, of both the peroneal (DL: P = 0.005, N-DL: P = 0.013) and tibial nerves (DL: P = 0.037, N-DL: P = 0.005) were found bilaterally, whereas no changes were observed in nerve ultrasound or other parameters of the NCS of both the upper and lower limbs. In these young healthy males, only the F waves, known to respond to postural changes, were significantly affected by short-term bed rest. These preliminary results suggest that during simulated microgravity, most changes occur at the muscle or central nervous system level. Since the assessment of F waves is common in clinical neurophysiological examinations, caution should be used when testing individuals after prolonged immobility.Copyright © 2021 the American Physiological Society.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:14Z,2022-08-24T07:29:14Z,NA,R495-R503,NA,3,321,NA,Am.

Although not as extreme as shift workers, adolescents often have delayed sleep timing and irregular eating patterns. The aim was to assess whether sleep midpoints-median of bed and wake time-and dietary patterns in adolescents were associated with DNA methylation of circadian genes. The study population included 142 Mexican youth (average age of 14.0 (SD = 2.0) years, 49% male). Average sleep midpoint over weekdays was estimated with actigraphy. Diet was assessed with a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and three dietary patterns were derived from principal component analysis, a Plant-based & lean proteins pattern, a Meat & starchy pattern, and an Eggs, milk & refined grain pattern. DNA methylation was quantified in blood leukocytes with the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip, and data from 548 CpG sites within 12 circadian genes were examined. Linear regression analyses, adjusted for sex, age, and % monocytes, showed that later sleep timing was associated with higher DNA methylation of several circadian genes, notably with RORB, PER1, CRY2, and NR1D1. Each of the dietary patterns examined was also related to circadian gene DNA methylation, but the Eggs, milk & refined grain pattern ('breakfast' pattern) had the clearest evidence of relationships with circadian genes, with inverse associations (lower DNA methylation) across all 12 genes. Findings suggest that timing-related sleep and eating behaviours among adolescents could result in epigenetic modification of clock genes.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:14Z,2022-08-24T07:29:14Z,NA,894-907,NA,8,16,NA,Epigenetics,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: United States Publisher: Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.",NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2006873177,*dietary intake; *DNA methylation; *sleep time; adolescent; article; birth weight; body fat; body mass; caloric intake; cryptochrome 2/ec [Endogenous Compound]; dietary pattern; egg; epigenetics; feeding behavior; female; food composition; food frequency questionnaire; food intake; gene expression; grain; human; human experiment; male; meat; microinjection; milk; monocyte; nuclear receptor NR1D1/ec [Endogenous Compound]; PER1 protein/ec [Endogenous Compound]; physical activity; pilot study; post hoc analysis; principal component analysis; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; refined grain; retinoid related orphan receptor alpha/ec [Endogenous Compound]; retinoid related orphan receptor beta/ec [Endogenous Compound]; RNA sequence; single nucleotide polymorphism; sleep; transcription factor ARNTL/ec [Endogenous Compound]; vegetarian diet; waist circumference; Wnt signaling,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Method(s): Researchers employed a VGG-16 based DL architecture, running inside a Long Short Term Memory algorithm design, to analyze prospectively obtained ultrasound video from pediatric patients presenting with dehydration to a busy urban ED, obtained for a prior clinical study. All videos were de-identified and no patient information was available. A total of 184 patient IVC ultrasound videos were used in the study. All videos were previously reviewed and graded by two blinded POCUS experts (PedEM resident and PedEM attending with 20 years experience) and split into two categories, those showing complete (95 patients) and those with incomplete (89 patients) IVC collapse. Approximately 10% (9) patient videos were randomly removed from each original data groups to be used for algorithm testing after training was completed. A standard 80%/20% training and validation split was used on the remaining 166 patient videos for algorithm training. Training accuracy, losses and learning curves were tracked and various training parameters such as learning rates and batch sizes were optimized throughout training. As a final real world test, the DL algorithm was tasked with analyzing the 18 previously unseen, randomly selected IVC videos. Cohen's kappa was calculated for each of the blinded POCUS reviewers and DL algorithm. Result(s): This DL algorithm completed analysis of each previously unseen real world test video and is the first such algorithm to analyze IVC collapse through visual estimation in real-time. The algorithm was able to deliver a collapse result prediction for all 18 test IVC videos and there were no failures. Algorithm agreement with PedEM POCUS attending was substantial with a Cohen's kappa of 0.78 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.0). Algorithm agreement with PedEM resident was substantial with Cohen's kappa of 0.66 (95% CI 0.31 to 1.0). The PEM resident and PEM POCUS attending also had substantial agreement, yielding a Cohen's kappa of 0.66 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.0). Conclusion(s): This DL algorithm developed on prospectively acquired IVC video data from patients being studied for an IVF resuscitation study proved accurate at identifying when the IVC collapsed completely in real time. There was substantial agreement with POCUS reviewers of the same videos. Such an algorithm could allow novice clinicians to rapidly identify complete IVC collapse in children and the need for IVF administration. This could expand patient access to point of care technology by enabling novices with little training to use the diagnostic tool at bedside and decide if patients require intravenous fluid administration.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

The PET insert has 18 sectors, and each sector is assembled with two-layer depth-of-interaction (DOI)-capable high-resolution block detectors. The PET scanner features a 16.7-cm-long axial field-of-view (FOV) to provide entire human brain images without bed movement. The PET scanner early digitizes a large number of block detector signals at a front-end data acquisition (DAQ) board using a novel field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-only signal digitization method. All the digitized PET data from the front-end DAQ boards are transferred using gigabit transceivers via non-magnetic high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) cables. A back-end DAQ system provides a common clock and synchronization signal for FPGAs over the HDMI cables. An active cooling system using copper heat pipes is applied for thermal regulation. All the 2.17-mm-pitch crystals with two-layer DOI information were clearly identified in the block detectors, exhibiting a system-level energy resolution of 12.6%. The PET scanner yielded clear hot-rod and Hoffman brain phantom images and demonstrated 3D PET imaging capability without bed movement. We also performed a pilot simultaneous PET/MR imaging study of a brain phantom.

Measuring methods can be based on electrocardiogram (ECG), sound, oximetry, or respiratory analysis. However, these approaches require devices placed on the human body or they are prone to disturbance by environmental influences. To solve these problems, we proposed a heart contraction mechanical trigger for unobtrusive detection of respiratory disorders from the mechanical measurement of cardiac contractions. We designed a novel method to calculate this mechanical trigger purely from measured mechanical signals without the use of ECG. Methods The approach is a built-on calculation of the so-called euclidean arc length from the signals. In comparison to previous researches, this system does not require any equipment attached to a person. This is achieved by locating the tensometers on the bed. Data from sensors are fused by the Cartan curvatures method to beat-to-beat vector input for the Convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier. Results In sum, 2281 disordered and 5130 normal breathing samples was collected for analysis. The experiments with use of 10-fold cross validation show that accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reach values of 96.37%, 92.46%, and 98.11% respectively. Conclusions By the approach for detection, the system offers a novel way for a completely unobtrusive diagnosis of breathing-related health problems. The proposed solution can effectively be deployed in all clinical or home environments.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,NA,106149,NA,"(Cimr, Studnicka, Cimler, Slegr) Faculty of Science, University of Hradec Kralove, Rokitanskeho 62, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czechia",207,NA,Comput.

A protocol to derive a clinical decision rule for the emergency department,BMJ Open,NA,2044-6055 (electronic),10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044800,http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/early/by/section,"Introduction Falling on level ground is now the most common cause of traumatic intracranial bleeding worldwide. Older adults frequently present to the emergency department (ED) after falling. It can be challenging for clinicians to determine who requires brain imaging to rule out traumatic intracranial bleeding, and often head injury decision rules do not apply to older adults who fall. The goal of our study is to derive a clinical decision rule, which will identify older adults who present to the ED after a fall who do not have clinically important intracranial bleeding. Methods and analysis This is a prospective cohort study enrolling patients aged 65 years or older, who present to the ED of 11 hospitals in Canada and the USA within 48 hours of having a fall. Patients are included if they fall on level ground, off a chair, toilet seat or out of bed. The primary outcome is the diagnosis of clinically important intracranial bleeding within 42 days of the index ED visit. An independent adjudication committee will determine the primary outcome, blinded to all other data. We are collecting data on 17 potential predictor variables. The treating physician completes a study data form at the time of initial assessment, prior to brain imaging. Data extraction is supplemented by an independent, structured electronic medical record review. We will perform binary recursive partitioning using Classification and Regression Trees to derive a clinical decision rule. Ethics and dissemination The study was initially approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Committee and subsequently approved by the research ethics boards governing all participating sites. We will disseminate our results by journal publication, presentation at international meetings and social media.

Method(s): Sixty-five consecutive PSP patients with <5 years of disease duration diagnosed according to MDS-PSP criteria, 25 PD patients and 25 controls comparable in age, education and disease duration were explored using a bedside battery of tests for the quantitative evaluation of oculomotor dysfunction in clinical practice. Other accepted scales were used for measurement of motor (PSPRS), cognitive (FAB) and behavioral (FBI) impairment. Result(s): Measurement of oculomotor dysfunction significantly differentiated PSP from PD and controls (p < 0.001) and showed high accuracy in the differential diagnosis of early-to-mid stage PSP from PD. PSP-Parkinsonism and PSP-Progressive Gait Freezing phenotypes showed more preserved ocular motor function compared to PSP-Richardson Syndrome, although no differences were found between PSP subtypes in the number of square wave jerks, optokinetic nystagmus defects, degree of apraxia of eyelid opening, or presence of the ""Round the Houses"" sign. Conclusion(s): Using a bedside clinical instrument for quantifying oculomotor disturbances in PSP shows promising potential at differentiating PSP from PD, and it seems able to provide a qualitative and quantitative description of ocular motor function in parkinsonian disorders.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,NA,63-68,NA,"(Pagonabarraga, Horta-Barba, Busteed, Bejr-kasem, Aracil-Bolanos, Marin-Lahoz, Pascual-Sedano, Perez, Campolongo, Izquierdo, Martinez-Horta, Sampedro, Kulisevsky) Movement Disorders Unit, Neurology Department, Hospital Sant Pau.

Insufficient sleep has been found to reduce the sensitivity to feedback as well as increase reward sensitivity. To determine whether insufficient sleep alters learning from positive and negative feedback, healthy participants (n = 32, mean age 29.0 years, 18 women) were tested once after normal sleep (8 hr time in bed for 2 nights) and once after 2 nights of sleep restriction (4 hr/night) on a probabilistic selection task where learning behaviour was evaluated in three ways: as generalised learning, short-term win-stay/lose-shift learning strategies, and trial-by-trial learning rate. Sleep restriction did not alter the sensitivity to either positive or negative feedback on generalised learning. Also, short-term win-stay/lose-shift strategies were not affected by sleep restriction. Similarly, results from computational models that assess the trial-by-trial update of stimuli value demonstrated no difference between sleep conditions after the first block. However, a slower learning rate from negative feedback when evaluating all learning blocks was found after sleep restriction. Despite a marked increase in sleepiness and slowed learning rate for negative feedback, sleep restriction did not appear to alter strategies and generalisation of learning from positive or negative feedback.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Heart rate variability (HRV) comprises changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats, which can be measured through acquisition and interpretation of electrocardiography (ECG) captured from bedside monitors or wearable devices. As increased sympathetic activity affects the HRV, an index of autonomic regulation of heart rate, ultra-short-term HRV analysis can provide a reliable source of information for acute pain monitoring. In this study, widely used HRV time and frequency domain measurements are used in acute pain assessments among postoperative patients. The existing approaches have only focused on stimulated pain in healthy subjects, whereas, to the best of our knowledge, there is no work in the literature building models using real pain data and on postoperative patients. Objective(s): The objective of our study was to develop and evaluate an automatic and adaptable pain assessment algorithm based on ECG features for assessing acute pain in postoperative patients likely experiencing mild to moderate pain. Method(s): The study used a prospective observational design. The sample consisted of 25 patient participants aged 18 to 65 years. In part 1 of the study, a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation unit was employed to obtain baseline discomfort thresholds for the patients. In part 2, a multichannel biosignal acquisition device was used as patients were engaging in non-noxious activities. At all times, pain intensity was measured using patient self-reports based on the Numerical Rating Scale. A weak supervision framework was inherited for rapid training data creation. The collected labels were then transformed from 11 intensity levels to 5 intensity levels. Prediction models were developed using 5 different machine learning methods. Mean prediction accuracy was calculated using leave-one-out cross-validation. We compared the performance of these models with the results from a previously published research study. Result(s): Five different machine learning algorithms were applied to perform a binary classification of baseline (BL) versus 4 distinct pain levels (PL1 through PL4). The highest validation accuracy using 3 time domain HRV features from a BioVid research paper for baseline versus any other pain level was achieved by support vector machine (SVM) with 62.72% (BL vs PL4) to 84.14% (BL vs PL2). Similar results were achieved for the top 8 features based on the Gini index using the SVM method, with an accuracy ranging from 63.86% (BL vs PL4) to 84.79% (BL vs PL2). Conclusion(s): We propose a novel pain assessment method for postoperative patients using ECG signal. Weak supervision applied for labeling and feature extraction improves the robustness of the approach. Our results show the viability of using a machine learning algorithm to accurately and objectively assess acute pain among hospitalized patients.Copyright © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

In addition to fall-related injuries due to the trauma itself, prolonged immobilization on the floor results in a wide range of comorbidities and may double the risk of death in elderly. Thus, reducing the length of Time On the Ground (TOG) in fallers seems crucial in vulnerable individuals with cognitive disorders who cannot get up independently. Objective(s): This study aimed to examine the effect of a new technology called SafelyYou Guardian (SYG) on early post-fall care including reduction of Time Until staff Assistance (TUA) and TOG. Method(s): SYG uses continuous video monitoring, artificial intelligence, secure networks, and customized computer applications to detect and notify caregivers about falls in real time while providing immediate access to video footage of falls. The present observational study was conducted in 6 California memory care facilities where SYG was installed in bedrooms of consenting residents and families. Fall events were video recorded over 10 months. During the baseline installation period (November 2017 to December 2017), SYG video captures of falls were not provided on a regular basis to facility staff review. During a second period (January 2018 to April 2018), video captures were delivered to facility staff on a regular weekly basis. During the third period (May 2018 to August 2018), real-time notification (RTN) of any fall was provided to facility staff. Two digital markers (TUA, TOG) were automatically measured and compared between the baseline period (first 2 months) and the RTN period (last 4 months). The total number of falls including those happening outside of the bedroom (such as common areas and bathrooms) was separately reported by facility staff. Result(s): A total of 436 falls were recorded in 66 participants suffering from Alzheimer disease or related dementias (mean age 87 years; minimum 65, maximum 104 years). Over 80% of the falls happened in bedrooms, with two-thirds occurring overnight (8 PM to 8 AM). While only 8.1% (22/272) of falls were scored as moderate or severe, fallers were not able to stand up alone in 97.6% (247/253) of the cases. Reductions of 28.3 (CI 19.6-37.1) minutes in TUA and 29.6 (CI 20.3-38.9) minutes in TOG were observed between the baseline and RTN periods. The proportion of fallers with TOG >1 hour fell from 31% (8/26; baseline) to zero events (RTN period). During the RTN period, 76.6% (108/141) of fallers received human staff assistance in less than 10 minutes, and 55.3% (78/141) of them spent less than 10 minutes on the ground. Conclusion(s): SYG technology is capable of reducing TOG and TUA while efficiently covering the area (bedroom) and time zone (nighttime) that are at highest risk. After 6 months of SYG monitoring, TOG was reduced by a factor of 3. The drastic reduction of TOG is likely to decrease secondary comorbid complications, improve post-fall prognosis, and reduce health care costs.Copyright ©Eleonore Bayen, Shirley Nickels, Glen Xiong, Julien Jacquemot, Raghav Subramaniam, Pulkit Agrawal, Raheema Hemraj, Alexandre Bayen, Bruce L Miller, George Netscher.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,NA,e17551,NA,6,23,NA,J.

Bedside ultrasound helps in the rapid diagnosis of these manifestations. Vscan ExtendTM (GE, Wauwatosa, WI, USA) is a handheld ultrasound device with a dual probe and an artificial intelligence application to detect ejection fraction. It can help in reducing the time for diagnosis, duration, and the number of healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19. This is a prospective observational study comparing the cardiorespiratory parameters and time duration for assessment between Vscan ExtendTM and the conventional ultrasound machine. Patients and Methods: Paired observations were made in 96 COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit by two intensivists. Intensivist A used the Vscan ExtendTM device to assess the cardiac function, lung fields, diaphragm, deep veins, and abdomen. Intensivist B used clinical examination, X-ray chest, ECG, and conventional echocardiogram for assessment. The agreement between the findings and the time duration required in both the methods was compared. Result(s): The use of handheld ultrasound has significantly decreased the duration of bedside examination of patients than the conventional method. The median duration of examination using handheld ultrasound was 9 (8.0-11.0) minutes, compared to 20 (17-22) minutes with the conventional method (P < 0.001). The Cohen's kappa coefficient was 1.0 for left ventricular systolic function, most of the lung fields, and diaphragmatic movement. Conclusion(s): Vscan ExtendTM helps in the rapid identification and diagnosis of cardiopulmonary manifestations in COVID-19 patients. The agreement between the handheld device and the conventional method proves its efficacy and safety.Copyright © Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,NA,524-527,NA,5,25,NA,Indian J.

To mitigate the adverse effects of poor lighting conditions and help older adults perceive their positions in a community-dwelling setting, destination-based visual perceptual cues were designed as a specific lighting intervention and the effectiveness of the lighting intervention was tested in this study. Research Questions: 1) Does the designed lighting intervention improve older adults' walking performance? 2) Does the designed lighting intervention change older adults' walking strategy? Methods: Fifteen community-dwelling older adults (165.5 +/- 9.3 cm, 6 males, 9 females) were recruited. Participants were instructed to walk from their bed to the bathroom repeatedly in two lighting conditions, their usual nightlight condition and a novel LED strip lighting condition. Human motion patterns, including walking performance, lower-limb kinematics, and trunk motions, were recorded and analyzed. To investigate the effect of visual cues on walking behaviors, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed with lighting conditions as the within-subject factor. Result(s): Destination-based visual perceptual cues induced less walking time among adults over 75 years old, compared to the usual nightlight condition. The decrease in walking time was accompanied by changes in other walking behaviors, including decreased hip flexion, increased ankle flexion, larger trunk planar acceleration RMS, and smoother trunk log dimensionless jerk. Significance: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of the designed lighting intervention upon the changes in older adults' walking performance and strategies. With the help of destination-based visual perceptual cues, the older adults spent a shorter period of time walking to their destination (i.e., walking faster), with an improvement in their walking strategies, such as mitigated lower-body biomechanical plasticity and smoother trunk movement.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,NA,110-116,NA,"(Luo, Hu) Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States",87,NA,Gait Posture,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Netherlands Publisher: Elsevier B.V.,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2011830832,*association; *gait; *visual information; acceleration; adaptation; aged; ankle flexion; article; community dwelling person; Fall Efficacy Scale International; female; hip flexion; human; illumination; independent living; kinematics; lower limb; male; motion; motion analysis system; motor control; motor dysfunction assessment; movement (physiology); pilot study; priority journal; senescence; signal processing; trunk; walking; walking distance; walking speed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Characterization of response heterogeneity and their underlying associations may assist in stratifying the health impact of the pandemic. Method(s): We obtained wearable data covering baseline, incremental mobility restriction, and lockdown periods from 1,824 city-dwelling, working adults aged 21-40 years, incorporating 206,381 nights of sleep and 334,038 days of PA. Distinct rest-activity rhythm (RAR) profiles were identified using k-means clustering, indicating participants' temporal distribution of step counts over the day. Hierarchical clustering of the proportion of days spent in each of these RAR profiles revealed four groups who expressed different mixtures of RAR profiles before and during the lockdown. Result(s): Time in bed increased by 20 min during the lockdown without loss of sleep efficiency, while social jetlag measures decreased by 15 min. Resting heart rate declined by ~2 bpm. PA dropped an average of 42%. Four groups with different compositions of RAR profiles were found. Three were better able to maintain PA and weekday/weekend differentiation during lockdown. The least active group comprising ~51% of the sample, were younger and predominantly singles. Habitually less active already, this group showed the greatest reduction in PA during lockdown with little weekday/weekend differences. Conclusion(s): In the early aftermath of COVID-19 mobility restriction, PA appears to be more severely affected than sleep. RAR evaluation uncovered heterogeneity of responses to lockdown that could associate with different outcomes should the resolution of COVID-19 be protracted.Copyright © Sleep Research Society 2020.

However, analyzing such unstructured data lacking a priori experimental design remains a significant challenge, especially when the data is multi-modal and long-term. New method: Here we describe an automated, behavior-first approach for analyzing simultaneously recorded long-term, naturalistic electrocorticography (ECoG) and behavior video data. We identify and characterize spontaneous human upper-limb movements by combining computer vision, discrete latent-variable modeling, and string pattern-matching on the video. Result(s): Our pipeline discovers and annotates over 40,000 instances of naturalistic arm movements in long term (7-9 day) behavioral videos, across 12 subjects. Analysis of the simultaneously recorded brain data reveals neural signatures of movement that corroborate previous findings. Our pipeline produces large training datasets for brain-computer interfacing applications, and we show decoding results from a movement initiation detection task. Comparison with existing methods: Spontaneous movements capture real-world neural and behavior variability that is missing from traditional cued tasks. Building beyond window-based movement detection metrics, our unsupervised discretization scheme produces a queryable pose representation, allowing localization of movements with finer temporal resolution. Conclusion(s): Our work addresses the unique analytic challenges of studying naturalistic human behaviors and contributes methods that may generalize to other neural recording modalities beyond ECoG. We publish our curated dataset and believe that it will be a valuable resource for future studies of naturalistic movements.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,NA,109199,NA,"(Singh, Rao) Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, United States",358,NA,J.

In healthy participants, how the brain responds to heartbeats, measured as the heartbeat-evoked response (HER), correlates with perceptual, bodily, and self-consciousness. Here we show that HERs in resting-state EEG data distinguishes between postcomatose male and female human patients (n = 68, split into training and validation samples) with the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and in patients in a minimally conscious state with high accuracy (random forest classifier, 87% accuracy, 96% sensitivity, and 50% specificity in the validation sample). Random EEG segments not locked to heartbeats were useful to predict unconsciousness/consciousness, but HERs were more accurate, indicating that HERs provide specific information on consciousness. HERs also led to more accurate classification than heart rate variability. HER-based consciousness scores correlate with glucose metabolism in the default-mode network node located in the right superior temporal sulcus, as well as with the right ventral occipitotemporal cortex. These results were obtained when consciousness was inferred from brain glucose met`abolism measured with positron emission topography. HERs reflected the consciousness diagnosis based on brain metabolism better than the consciousness diagnosis based on behavior (Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, 77% validation accuracy). HERs thus seem to capture a capacity for consciousness that does not necessarily translate into intentional overt behavior. These results confirm the role of HERs in consciousness, offer new leads for future bedside testing, and highlight the importance of defining consciousness and its neural mechanisms independently from behavior.Copyright © 2021 the authors.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,NA,5251-5262,NA,24,41,NA,J.

To fully exploit this potential, safe and effective treatments are needed to ensure long-term metastases control. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is one means, however, for moving liver tumors correct delivery of high doses is challenging. After validating equal in-vivo treatment accuracy, we analyzed a pooled multi-platform liver-SBRT-database for clinical outcome. Method(s): Local control (LC), progression-free interval (PFI), overall survival (OS), predictive factors and toxicity was evaluated in 135 patients with 227 metastases treated by gantry-based SBRT (deep-inspiratory breath-hold-gating; n = 71) and robotic-based SBRT (fiducial-tracking, n = 156) with mean gross tumor volume biological effective dose (GTV-BEDalpha/beta=10Gy) of 146.6 Gy10. Result(s): One-, and five-year LC was 90% and 68.7%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, LC was significantly predicted by colorectal histology (p = 0.006). Median OS was 20 months with one- and two-year OS of 67% and 37%. On multivariate analysis, ECOG-status (p = 0.003), simultaneous chemotherapy (p = 0.003), time from metastasis detection to SBRT-treatment (>=2months; p = 0.021) and LC of the treated metastases (>=12 months, p < 0.009) were significant predictors for OS. One- and two-year PFI were 30.5% and 14%. Acute toxicity was mild and rare (14.4% grade I, 2.3% grade II, 0.6% grade III). Chronic degreeIII/IV toxicities occurred in 1.1%. Conclusion(s): Patient selection, time to treatment and sufficient doses are essential to achieve optimal outcome for SBRT with active motion compensation. Local control appears favorable compared to historical control. Long-term LC of the treated lesions was associated with longer overall survival.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,NA,230-236,NA,"(Stera, Rodel) University Hospital Frankfurt, Department of Radiation Oncology, Frankfurt am Main, Germany",158,NA,Radiother.

Material(s) and Method(s): Narrative review Results: Delayed activation of EMS for stroke symptoms by patients and witnesses deprives patients of rapid access to brain-saving therapies and occurs due to public unawareness of stroke features, cognitive and motor deficits produced by the stroke itself, and sleep onset. A promising emerging approach to overcoming the inherent biologic constraints of patient capacity to self-detect and respond to stroke symptoms is continuous monitoring by mobile health technologies with wireless sensors and artificial intelligence recognition systems. This review surveys 11 sensing technologies - accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, pressure sensors, touch screen and keyboard input detectors, artificial vision, and artificial hearing; and 10 consumer device form factors in which they are increasingly implemented: smartphones, smart speakers, smart watches and fitness bands, smart speakers/voice assistants, home health robots, smart clothing, smart beds, closed circuit television, smart rings, and desktop/laptop/tablet computers. Conclusion(s): The increase in computing power, wearable sensors, and mobile connectivity have ushered in an array of mobile health technologies that can transform stroke detection and EMS activation. By continuously monitoring a diverse range of biometric parameters, commercially available devices provide the technologic capability to detect cardinal language, motor, gait, and sensory signs of stroke onset. Intensified translational research to convert the promise of these technologies to validated, accurate real-world deployments are an important next priority for stroke investigation.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,2022-08-24T07:29:15Z,NA,105826,NA,7,30,NA,J.

OBJECTIVE(S): The prediction model of length of stay after total knee arthroplasty was established based on clinical data. Seven machine learning algorithms were used to construct the model, evaluate the effectiveness of different algorithms, and obtain the most relevant influencing factors of length of stay. METHOD(S): Through the hospital medical record system, a total of 777 patients who underwent total knee arthroplasty that met the inclusion criteria from January 2012 to December 2019 were collected. The patient's clinical data and past medical history were entered in detail. Seven kinds of machine learning, such as logistic regression, multiple adaptive regression, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient extraction algorithm, and artificial neural network, were used to build an algorithm model, and the 10-fold cross-validation method is used to verify the effectiveness of the model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and F1 score of the seven models were calculated and compared. The importance of the predictive variables of the artificial neural network model, the neural network architecture and draw heat maps related to the traits were evaluated. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): (1) We included a total of 777 samples, including 618 patients who were hospitalized for less than or equal to 6 days and 159 patients who were hospitalized for more than 6 days. (2) There were significant differences in age, preoperative hemoglobin, operation method, diabetes history, ischemic heart disease history, cerebrovascular disease history and blood transfusion between the two groups (P < 0.05). (3) Logistic regression, multiple adaptive regression, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, random forest, extreme gradient algorithm and artificial neural network area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.770, 0.778, 0.609, 0.570, 0.594, 0.586, and 0.903 in sequence. The prediction efficiency of artificial neural network was the best. Simultaneously, through the comparison of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score, it is found that the artificial neural network performs best, followed by logistic regression and multiple adaptive regression algorithms. (4) In the artificial neural network model, the length and age of surgery were the most important among the predictors, leading the other predictors, and the history of heart failure, cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, surgical methods, hemoglobin, blood transfusion, insulin use, history of diabetes, and obstructive sleep apnea were less important than the first two, but they were still highly correlated predictors. The neural network architecture also confirms the importance of these factors. (5) It is concluded that the three machine learning algorithms of artificial neural network, logistic regression and multiple adaptive regression algorithm can be used to predict the length of hospitalization after total knee arthroplasty, but the prediction effect of artificial neural network was more than that of logistic regression and meta-adaptive regression algorithm accurate. The length of surgery, age, history of heart failure, cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, surgical method and hemoglobin are closely related to the length of hospitalization in the artificial neural network model. Simultaneously, using the neural network model can personally predict the patient. The artificial neural network prediction model has a high recognition efficiency, which helps to improve the utilization rate of hospital beds and better plan the length of hospital stay.Copyright © 2021, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research.

Many clinicians assume that there are no postural issues in early PD because of failure to identify them on bedside and clinical testing. Here, we quantify balance changes in early and moderate stage PD and compared these values to healthy controls (HC) using clinical assessments of balance and posturography. Methods We compared 15 HC with 15 early PD (PD-II; Hoehn and Yahr stage II) and 15 moderate PD (PD-III; H&Y stage III). Participants performed various clinical tests of balance and a standing postural task on a force platform. We quantified the spatiotemporal parameters of the center of pressure (COP), the sample entropy and power spectral density (PSD) of the COP. Results The PSD of the COP differentiated PD-II from HC from 0-0.5 Hz and PD-II from PD-III from 0.5-1 Hz. Specifically, PD-II and PD-III manifested greater power than HC from 0-0.5 Hz, whereas PD-III exhibited greater power than PD-II and HC from 0.5-1.0 Hz (p<0.05). However, there were no significant differences between PD-II and HC in all clinical tests and in spatiotemporal parameters of the COP (p>0.05). Although the sample entropy was significantly lower in the PD groups (p<0.05), entropy failed to differentiate PD-II from PD-III. Conclusion The low-frequency modulation of the COP in this small cohort differentiated early PD from HC and from moderate PD. Clinicians should be aware that there are early balance deficits in PD. A larger sample size is needed to confirm these findings.Copyright © 2021 Kamieniarz et al.

An algorithm is to divide the patients into primary and revision cases then to further subdivide patients who have glenoid bone loss <20% and/or an engaging or off-track Hill-Sachs lesion. A bipolar lesion with either of these conditions is an indication for a bone block open Laterjet procedure. In the revision setting, the threshold for Laterjet is lower. Soft-tissue lesions are indications for a Bankart or labral repair. With the proper attention given to concomitant labral, biceps, and rotator cuff pathology, Hill-Sachs lesions less than 1 cm are left alone. However, in situations where lesions are deeper than 1 cm, an arthroscopic remplissage is indicated. An optimal repair aims to create a labral bumper and a bony bed for the soft tissue to heal, whereas inferior quality of soft tissue indicates a segmental labral reconstruction.

Novel technologies that can quantify sleep quality at scale are required to enable the diagnosis and epidemiology of poor sleep. One important indicator of sleep quality is body posture. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a non-contact sleep monitoring system that analyses body posture and movement. Supervised machine learning strategies applied to noncontact vision-based infrared camera data using a transfer learning approach, successfully quantified sleep poses of participants covered by a blanket. This represents the first occasion that such a machine learning approach has been used to successfully detect four predefined poses and the empty bed state during 8-10 hour overnight sleep episodes representing a realistic domestic sleep situation. The methodology was evaluated against manually scored sleep poses and poses estimated using clinical polysomnography measurement technology. In a cohort of 12 healthy participants, we find that a ResNet-152 pre-trained network achieved the best performance compared with the standard de novo CNN network and other pre-trained networks. The performance of our approach was better than other video-based methods for sleep pose estimation and produced higher performance compared to the clinical standard for pose estimation using a polysomnography position sensor. It can be concluded that infrared video capture coupled with deep learning AI can be successfully used to quantify sleep poses as well as the transitions between poses in realistic nocturnal conditions, and that this non-contact approach provides superior pose estimation compared to currently accepted clinical methods.Copyright © 2001-2011 IEEE.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:16Z,2022-08-24T07:29:16Z,NA,290-299,NA,"(Mohammadi, Enshaeifar, Hilton, Wells) Centre for Vision Speech and Signal Processing, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Science, University of Surrey, Guildford GU2 7XH, United Kingdom",29,NA,IEEE Trans.

The authors report that patients with low AHI (<= 4 mmHg bpm) had an in-hospital mortality that was 2.5 times higher than patients with an higher AHI. In the present analysis from the BREATHE registry only patients with evidence of left ventricle ejection fraction below 40% were included, contrary to most of the previous publications. Although previous studies, generally based on outpatients with chronic heart failure (HF), have identified a number of variables that are associated with increased mortality, including etiology, patient age, peak oxygen consumption, left ventricular ejection fraction, serum sodium concentration, and B-type natriuretic peptide concentration, several factors have limited the development of similar models in patients with AHF, such as lack of a consistent definition of AHF, incomplete data in administrative data sets, and varying statistical methods. Consequently, unlike acute coronary syndromes, in which several systems have been developed for risk stratification, no clinically practical method of risk stratification exists for patients with AHF. Results from the American multicenter ADHERE HF Registry identified blood urea nitrogen level, systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), and age as the most significant predictors of mortality in patients with AHF.1 Others studies.Copyright © 2021, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

The pressure reactivity index (PRx) is a frequently used correlation coefficient between ABP and ICP to inform clinicians at the bedside about trends in global cerebrovascular pressure regulation status. We present an unexpected influence of cyclic anti-decubitus mattress inflations and deflations on invasive ICP, ABP and PRx calculations in our TBI patients. This might affect autoregulation guided management. In our database, 23% (9/39) of the patients show recurrent peaks in the monitoring signals. We hypothesize that these peaks are caused by (a combination) of hydrostatic change, local (cervical) compression and/or incorrect sensor zeroing due to positional changes induced by the anti-decubitus mattress. This warrants further investigation by the manufacturer and exploration of data filters.Copyright © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:16Z,2022-08-24T07:29:16Z,NA,423-425,NA,2,35,NA,J.

Objective(s): Development of a pressure injury (PI) risk screening instrument for use during spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. Setting(s): Tertiary rehabilitation center. Method(s): Medical charts of 807 inpatients participating in SCI rehabilitation were reviewed. Two models (recursive partitioning and logistic regression) were developed with demographic and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) variables and compared with the SCI Pressure Ulcer Scale (SCIPUS, n = 603) and Braden scale (n = 100) using modeling (n = 615) and validation (n = 192) datasets. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were completed for each model. Models yielding high sensitivity and area under the curve (AUC), while minimizing false negatives (FN < 0.5%) were preferred. Result(s): In the modeling dataset, a single dichotomized FIM variable, Bed/Chair Transfers <4, was predictive of PI incidence (sensitivity = 97%, AUC = 74%, FN = 0.49%) and had similar metrics as the logistic regression model (sensitivity = 97%, AUC = 76%, FN = 0.49%). The recursive partitioning model had fewer FN (sensitivity = 98%, AUC = 75%, FN = 0.33%). When applied to the validation dataset, both models performed similarly. The SCIPUS performed poorly (AUC < 70%). When analyses were limited to cases with available Braden data and no admission PI, recursive partitioning outperformed the other methods for PI risk screening. Conclusion(s): A recursive partitioning model, named the SCI-PreSORS (SCI Pressure Sore Onset Risk Screening), demonstrated promise for PI risk screening during inpatient SCI rehabilitation. Prospective validation of the new model is warranted.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Spinal Cord Society.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:16Z,2022-08-24T07:29:16Z,NA,123-131,NA,2,59,NA,Spinal Cord,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Springer Nature,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2005633246,*clinical assessment tool; *decubitus/co [Complication]; *decubitus/ep [Epidemiology]; *disease risk assessment; *spinal cord injury/rh [Rehabilitation]; adult; aged; article; bed; Braden Scale; chair; clinical decision making; cohort analysis; decision tree; demography; false negative result; female; Functional Independence Measure; human; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal; psychometry; rating scale; receiver operating characteristic; recursive partitioning; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; tertiary care center; validation study,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods Parents of healthy preschool (3-6-year-old) children (n = 610; 294 males) were asked to help them to wear an accelerometer for 7 to 10 days and 24 hours/day on their waist. Children with >3 nights of valid recordings were randomly allocated to the development (n = 200) and validation (n = 200) groups. Wear periods from accelerometer recordings were identified minute-by-minute as bedrest or wake using visual identification by two independent raters. To automate visual identification, chosen decision tree (DT) parameters (block length, threshold, bedrest-start trigger, and bedrest-end trigger) were optimized in the development group using a Nelder-Mead simplex optimization method, which maximized the accuracy of DT-identified bedrest in 1-min epochs against synchronized visually identified bedrest (n = 4,730,734). DT's performance with optimized parameters was compared with the visual identification, commonly used Sadeh's sleep detection algorithm, DT for youth (10-18-years-old), and parental survey of sleep duration in the validation group. Results On average, children wore an accelerometer for 8.3 days and 20.8 hours/day. Comparing the DT-identified bedrest with visual identification in the validation group yielded sensitivity = 0.941, specificity = 0.974, and accuracy = 0.956. The optimal block length was 36 min, the threshold 230 counts/min, the bedrest-start trigger 305 counts/min, and the bedrest-end trigger 1,129 counts/min. In the validation group, DT identified bedrest with greater accuracy than Sadeh's algorithm (0.956 and 0.902) and DT for youth (0.956 and 0.861) (both P<0.001). Both DT (564+/-77 min/day) and Sadeh's algorithm (604+/-80 min/day) identified significantly less bedrest/sleep than parental survey (650+/-81 min/day) (both P<0.001). Conclusions The DT-based algorithm initially developed for youth was adapted for preschool children to identify time spent in bedrest with high accuracy. The DT is available as a package for the R open-source software environment (""PhysActBedRest"").Copyright © 2021 Tracy et al.

It may be benign, but can also be a symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) a prevalent sleep disorder. Accurate detection of snoring may help with screening and diagnosis of OSA. Method(s): We introduce a snore detection algorithm based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). We obtained audio recordings of 38 subjects referred to a clinical center for a sleep study. All subjects were recorded by a total of 5 microphones placed at strategic positions around the bed. The CNN was used to extract features from the sound spectrogram, while the RNN was used to process the sequential CNN output and to classify the audio events to snore and non-snore events. We also addressed the impact of microphone placement on the performance of the algorithm. Result(s): The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 95.3 +/- 0.5%, a sensitivity of 92.2 +/- 0.9%, and a specificity of 97.7 +/- 0.4% over all microphones in snore detection on our data set including 18412 sound events. The best accuracy (95.9%) was observed from the microphone placed about 70 cm above the subject's head and the worst (94.4%) was observed from the microphone placed about 130 cm above the subject's head. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that our method detects snore events from audio recordings with high accuracy and that microphone placement does not have a major impact on detection performance.Copyright © 2020",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,NA,105917,NA,"(Xie, Aubert, Long, van Dijk, Arsenali, Fonseca, Overeem) Biomedical Diagnostics Group, Department of Electrical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, MB 5600, Netherlands",200,NA,Comput.

This practice is subjective, inconsistent, slow, and discontinuous. To develop a reliable medical interpretation, several automated approaches have been proposed to enhance the current practice. These approaches are unimodal and focus mainly on assessing neonatal procedural (acute) pain. As pain is a multimodal emotion that is often expressed through multiple modalities, the multimodal assessment of pain is necessary especially in case of postoperative (acute prolonged) pain. Additionally, spatio-temporal analysis is more stable over time and has been proven to be highly effective at minimizing misclassification errors. In this paper, we present a novel multimodal spatio-temporal approach that integrates visual and vocal signals and uses them for assessing neonatal postoperative pain. We conduct comprehensive experiments to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We compare the performance of the multimodal and unimodal postoperative pain assessment, and measure the impact of temporal information integration. The experimental results, on a real-world dataset, show that the proposed multimodal spatio-temporal approach achieves the highest AUC (0.87) and accuracy (79%), which are on average 6.67% and 6.33% higher than unimodal approaches. The results also show that the integration of temporal information markedly improves the performance as compared to the non-temporal approach as it captures changes in the pain dynamic. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach can be used as a viable alternative to manual assessment, which would tread a path toward fully automated pain monitoring in clinical settings, point-of-care testing, and homes.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,NA,104150,NA,"(Salekin, Zamzmi, Goldgof, Kasturi, Sun) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, United States",129,NA,Comput.

METHOD(S): Data were obtained from the nationwide prospective Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee (CHECK) study (n=1002). Incident hip OA was defined as fulfilling the clinical ACR criteria for hip OA, a Kellgren and Lawrence score >=2 with hip pain, or received a hip replacement during follow-up. Baseline measurements were used of participants with hip complaints and without hip OA. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the number of correlated variables. Associations between baseline characteristics (including PCA components) and incident hip OA were investigated using logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex and BMI.

Incident hip OA was associated with (i) component 1 (general presence of pain and symptoms) [odds ratio (OR)=1.46 (95%CI: 1.08, 1.98)], (ii) component 3 (relatively high levels of pain during shopping/walking combined with less difficulty with putting socks on/off and rising from bed) [OR=1.58 (95%CI: 1.18, 2.12)] and (iii) knee pain [OR=0.34 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.66)]. CONCLUSION(S): In first presenters with hip complaints, use of a few history-taking variables might allow better recognition of those at higher odds for incident hip OA within 10 years.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

In this work, deep learning methods are used for heart rate estimation from BCG signals and are compared against five digital signal processing methods found in literature.Approach.The models are evaluated on a dataset featuring BCG recordings from 42 patients, acquired with a pneumatic system. Several different deep learning architectures, including convolutional, recurrent and a combination of both are investigated. Besides model performance, we are also concerned about model size and specifically investigate less complex and smaller networks.Main results.Deep learning models outperform traditional methods by a large margin. Across 14 patients in a held-out testing set, an architecture with stacked convolutional and recurrent layers achieves an average mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.07 beat min-1, whereas the best-performing traditional method reaches 4.24 beat min-1. Besides smaller errors, deep learning models show more consistent performance across different patients, indicating the ability to better deal with inter-patient variability, a prevalent issue in BCG analysis. In addition, we develop a smaller version of the best-performing architecture, that only features 8283 parameters, yet still achieves an average MAE of 2.32 beat min-1on the testing set.Significance.This is the first study that applies and compares different deep learning architectures to heart rate estimation from bed-based BCG signals. Compared to signal processing algorithms, deep learning models show dramatically smaller errors and more consistent results across different individuals. The results show that using smaller models instead of excessively large ones can lead to sufficient performance for specific biosignal processing applications. Additionally, we investigate the use of fully convolutional networks for 1D signal processing, which is rarely applied in literature.Copyright © 2021 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,NA,NA,NA,7,42,NA,Physiol Meas,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United Kingdom Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=635508624,*ballistocardiography; algorithm; heart rate; human,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Existing sleep posture monitoring and classification systems may not be able to accommodate the covering of a blanket, which represents a barrier to conducting pragmatic studies. The objective of this study was to develop an unobtrusive sleep posture classification that could accommodate the use of a blanket. The system uses an infrared depth camera for data acquisition and a convolutional neural network to classify sleeping postures. We recruited 66 participants (40 men and 26 women) to perform seven major sleeping postures (supine, prone (head left and right), log (left and right) and fetal (left and right)) under four blanket conditions (thick, medium, thin, and no blanket). Data augmentation was conducted by affine transformation and data fusion, generating additional blanket conditions with the original dataset. Coarse-grained (four-posture) and fine-grained (seven-posture) classifiers were trained using two fully connected network layers. For the coarse classification, the log and fetal postures were merged into a side-lying class and the prone class (head left and right) was pooled. The results show a drop of overall F1-score by 8.2% when switching to the fine-grained classifier. In addition, compared to no blanket, a thick blanket reduced the overall F1-scores by 3.5% and 8.9% for the coarse- and fine-grained classifiers, respectively; meanwhile, the lowest performance was seen in classifying the log (right) posture under a thick blanket, with an F1-score of 72.0%. In conclusion, we developed a system that can classify seven types of common sleeping postures under blankets and achieved an F1-score of 88.9%.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,NA,NA,NA,16,21,NA,Sensors (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Switzerland Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=636015827,*body position; *camera; *convolutional neural network; *deep learning; *infrared radiation; *sleep disorder; affine transform; article; classifier; female; fetus; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Method(s): This study was an analysis of sleep data from three cross-sectional studies of the Precision in Symptom Self-Management Center at Columbia University. All studies focused on sleep health in Latinx adults at increased risk for sleep disturbance. Data on total sleep time (TST), time in bed (TIB), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep efficiency (SE), number of awakenings (NOA) and the mean length of nightly awakenings were collected using wrist-mounted accelerometers. Cluster analysis of the sleep data was conducted using an unsupervised machine learning approach that relies on mixtures of multivariate generalized linear mixed models. Result(s): The analytic sample included 494 days of data from 118 adults (Ages 19-77). A 3-cluster model provided the best fit based on deviance indices (ie, DDELTA~ -75 and -17 from 1- and 2- to 3-cluster models, respectively) and likelihood ratio (Pdiff ~ 0.93). Phenotype 1 (n = 64) was associated with greater likelihood of overall adequate SE and less variability in SE and WASO. Phenotype 2 (n = 11) was characterized by higher NOAs, and greater WASO and TIB than the other phenotypes. Phenotype 3 (n = 43) was characterized by greater variability in SE, bed times and awakening times. Conclusion(s): Robust digital data-driven modeling approaches can be useful for detecting sleep phenotypes from heterogenous patient populations, and have implications for designing precision sleep health strategies for management and early detection of sleep problems.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,NA,211-220,NA,"(Ensari, Caceres, Bakken) Columbia University Data Science Institute, New York, NY 10025, United States",85,NA,Sleep Med.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Netherlands Publisher: Elsevier B.V.,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed22&NEWS=N&AN=2013897607,*actimetry; *minority health; *phenotype; *sleep pattern; *unsupervised machine learning; accelerometer; adult; aged; arousal; article; cluster analysis; Colombia; cross-sectional study; disease simulation; female; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; self care; sleep disorder; sleep efficiency; time in bed; wake after sleep onset; wrist,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aims of the study were to translate the original (i.e., English) version of the SHI into Spanish and to evaluate the psychometric properties of this instrument (i.e., factor structure, internal consistency reliability, and concurrent, predictive, and discriminant validity) in Spanish adults. The overall sample, comprising 548 university students, was divided into two groups based on their self-reported insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index) because sleep hygiene has been shown to be closely related to insomnia. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale were used for testing concurrent validity. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale was used for testing predictive validity. Three items were dropped from the original SHI scale due to their low factor loadings. The principal component analysis revealed a four-factor solution for the SHI, accounting for 65.58% of the total variance in the overall sample, for 65.34% in the noninsomnia group, and for 63.50% in the insomnia group. Factor 1 comprised items regarding sleep-disrupting behaviors; Factor 2 comprised items regarding cognitive activation; Factor 3 comprised items about bedroom comfort; and Factor 4 comprised items on sleep/wake time. Omega coefficient indices for the SHI ranged from 0.751 to 0.878 in the overall sample, from 0.734 to 0.822 in the noninsomnia group, and from 0.724 to 0.835 in the insomnia group.

Patients treated in the ICU or operating room (OR) are continuously monitored with several parameters, yielding large amounts of physiological data. We hypothesize that a machine learning (ML) algorithm can detect events with cerebral hypoperfusion and ischemia in patients in the ICU or OR. Method(s): In a first of a three-phase observational study with the aim of training a ML-algorithm to predict and detect cerebral ischemia using data collected from bedside monitors, we studied patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. Patients were monitored with SpO2, continuous ABP, ECG, near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS), and electroencephalography. Data was exported to a computer, cleaned, and labelled. The perioperative period was divided into 7 events. Feature extraction of the data was done in Python programming environment. Heart rate variability parameters were extracted from the ECG. We quantified all variables per minute. This provided us with a large matrix of all features for each minute (data point). The data points were then labelled with the event name. The feature matrix was used to train a random forest algorithm. Result(s): Nine patients were included in a pilot study. Recognition of the clinical events was achieved with an accuracy of 82-98%, precision (specificity) 86-98%, and recall (sensitivity) 87-98%. Accuracy was not affected when NIRS-values were excluded from analysis. Using decision tree or support vector machine algorithms yielded similar results. Conclusion(s): It is possible for a ML-algorithm to differ between clinical events, including clamping of the carotid arteries, in a controlled environment. Artificial intelligence and ML can help utilize big data generated in the ICU and OR. We will continue our research to help develop models able to aid clinicians detect cerebral ischemia in real time, using data generated from bedside monitors.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,NA,NA,NA,SUPPL 1,25,NA,Crit.

GOGO Band utilizes real time heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and applied artificial intelligence (AI) to create an alarm that is capable of waking the patient up prior to wetting . Our Aim was to evaluate the efficacy the new Smart GoGo Band. METHOD(S): Data was retrieved and analyzed from our servers, of patients who purchased the GOGO Band which includes a heart rate monitor, moisture sensor, bedside tablet and app for the parents phone in this study. There are 3 modes, training; where the individualized HRV parameters are used to build the alerting model. Once patients are done with training, they enter the Predictive mode where they receive an alarm if an impending urination event is noted. In Weaning mode the alerting is gradually suppressed. Only patients that used the alarm for more than 30 days were included. Data analysis was done with SPSS and xlstat. RESULT(S): A total of 40 subjects that have used the system for more than 30 nights were included in this analysis. Gender mix was 33 males (82.5%) and 7 females (17.5%). The mean age of the subjects is 10.6 yrs. Subjects wet the bed an average of 6.2 nights per week prior to treatment. Severity and number of accidents per night had no impact on the ability to achieve dryness with the GOGO Band device in logistical regression analysis. The data was also segregated based on compliance since it became clear during the analysis that compliant patients achieved better results than non-compliant patients. The figure depicts the degree of predictive alarming and the patient's ability to stay dry. It is clear that the high compliance patients (green dots) have less alarming events indicating that the system is just not functioning randomly but the machine learning algorithm has learned to sense when an accident is impending. CONCLUSION(S): Our findings indicate that the GOGO Band in high compliance patients has a 93% dry night rate that surpasses standard alarms. The data indicates that there are physiological changes which lead to a change in bladder-brain processing that allows for the patient to sleep through the night and not wet themselves.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,2022-08-24T07:29:17Z,NA,e273-e274,NA,SUPPL 3,206,NA,J.

However, it is unclear whether such information could be used within an Early Warning System. We developed a method for quantifying behaviours, and measured whether this behavioural measure improved prediction of clinical deterioration in stroke in-patients. Method(s): Participants wore 4 inertial movement unit watches on wrists and ankles, allowing them to engage in everyday activities. Watch data was paired with annotated videos to train a deep learning model, enabling classifications of five behaviours (lying flat, sitting up in bed, sitting upright, standing or walking). Subjects were either instructed to perform a series of behaviours, or left to act as they wished. Cross-validation F1 scores for instructed sessions were: 0.95 (SE+/-0.01; n=18); and for free-living: 0.88 -0.74 (SE+/-0.04 +/-0.11; n=41). Subsequently we applied our system to stroke inpatients during daytime hours and assessed whether behavioral quantification was an independent predictor of clinical deterioration. Result(s): Of 61 recruited subjects, 22 (36%) deteriorated over the following 5 days. The strongest clinical predictors of deterioration (stroke severity, baseline mobility, brain hemorrhage) together enabled a predictive accuracy of 72% (AUROCC: 0.64); while adding daytime behavioral metrics -particularly time spent in bed -increased this to 78% (AUROCC: 0.79).

BIGENOMIC ASSOCIATION STUDY OF ACCELEROMETER-DERIVED AND SELF-REPORTED SLEEP PROPERTIES ACROSS UK BIOBANK PARTICIPANTS WITH LIFETIME MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER,European Neuropsychopharmacology,NA,0924-977X,10.1016/j.euroneuro.2021.08.031,NA,"Background: There is a well-known bidirectional causal relationship between sleep problems and major depressive disorder (MDD). Insomnia leads to a three-fold increase in depression risk while depression causes a two-fold increase in insomnia. MDD patients with comorbid sleep problems have worse outcomes, including a greater risk of suicide. Mitochondria are of recent interest in this context because they are a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Sleep facilitates the body to clear excess ROS that has accumulated through the day. Both human and animal studies have shown that mitochondria play a significant role in sleep. These dynamic organelles are not only encoded for by genes found in the nucleus (nuclear DNA), but they also have their own genome (mtDNA). We aimed to determine the genetic underpinnings, including the mitochondrial genome, of both objective and subjective sleep disturbance among individuals with lifetime MDD. Method(s): Using the UK Biobank Resource, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for both accelerometer-derived sleep measures and self-reported sleep properties across participants with inpatient F32 (depressive episode) or F33 (recurrent depressive disorder) ICD-10 codes. We included eight accelerometer-derived sleep measures (bedtime, wake time, sleep duration, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, duration of longest sleep bout and total nap duration) and five self-reported sleep properties (sleep duration, ease of morning awakening, frequency of napping, sleeplessness/insomnia and daytime dozing). Sleep measures were derived using the BiobankAccelerometerAnalysis software for activity segmentation, followed by the Heuristic algorithm looking at Distribution of Change in Z-Angle (HDCZA) from the popular GGIR accelerometry R package for determination of the primary sleep period. GWAS were conducted using linear regression, except for self-reported napping frequency, sleeplessness/insomnia and daytime dozing, which were dichotomized and analyzed using logistic regression. Covariates comprised sex, age at recruitment, number of cigarettes smoked daily (recoded as binary to represent smoker or non-smoker) and genotyping array (Axiom versus BiLEVE). Result(s): We found no genome-wide-significant hits for self-reported sleep properties (N=18,555) but three for accelerometer-derived sleep measures in N=2,432 individuals: one hit near SMARCA2 for sleep duration (p=1.5 x 10-8); another in an intron of CEP112 (near PRKCA) for sleep efficiency (p=2.0 x 10-8); and a third near RCAN3 for nap duration (p=3.8 x 10-8). Mitochondrial genome results will be available at the WCPG meeting. SMARCA2 encodes the core ATPase subunit of the BAF (mammalian SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, implicated in neurodevelopmental delay and schizophrenia. PRKCA (protein kinase C alpha) is a well-known upstream regulator of neuronal ERK signaling and an integral component of the mammalian circadian clock. Lastly, RCAN3 is a member of the regulator of calcineurin (RCAN) family; RCANs play roles in mitochondrial homeostasis, circadian rhythms, and immune response. Discussion(s): We implicated BAF-mediated chromatin remodeling and circadian rhythm-related genes in the pathophysiology of sleep disturbance among individuals with lifetime MDD. We will attempt to replicate our top findings in an Australian sample of N=16,000 depressed individuals (Head: Dr. N Martin).

Unobtrusive and ecologically valid methods to monitor longitudinal sleep metrics may therefore have practical value for surveillance and monitoring of infectious illnesses. We leveraged sleep metrics from Sleep Number 360 smart bed users to build a COVID-19 predictive model. Method(s): An IRB approved survey was presented to opting-in users from August to November 2020. COVID-19 test results were reported by 2003/6878 respondents (116 positive; 1887 negative). From the positive group, data from 82 responders (44.7+/-11.3 yrs.) who reported the date of symptom onset were used. From the negative group, data from 1519 responders (48.4+/-12.9 yrs.) who reported testing dates were used. Sleep duration, sleep quality, restful sleep duration, time to fall asleep, respiration rate, heart rate, and motion level were obtained from ballistocardiography signals stored in the cloud. Data from January to October 2020 were considered. The predictive model consists of two levels: 1) the daily probability of staying healthy calculated by logistic regression and 2) a continuous density Hidden Markov Model to refine the daily prediction considering the past decision history. Result(s): With respect to their baseline, significant increases in sleep duration, average breathing rate, average heart rate and decrease in sleep quality were associated with symptom exacerbation in COVID- 19 positive respondents. In COVID-19 negative respondents, no significant sleep or cardiorespiratory metrics were observed. Evaluation of the predictive model resulted in cross-validated area under the receiving-operator curve (AUC) estimate of 0.84+/-0.09 which is similar to values reported for wearable-sensors. Considering additional days to confirm prediction improved the AUC estimate to 0.93+/-0.05. Conclusion(s): The results obtained on the smart bed user population suggest that unobtrusive sleep metrics may offer rich information to predict and track the development of symptoms in individuals infected with COVID-19.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:18Z,2022-08-24T07:29:18Z,NA,A255,NA,SUPPL 2,44,NA,Sleep,NA,35th Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies.

Global events like the COVID-19 pandemic may increase vulnerability to depression and anxiety in this population. Poor sleep is often associated with depression, and both sleep and mood have been shown to be strongly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with most studies focusing on adults. The current study investigates psychological distress in young adolescents during the pandemic, and specifically, whether poor sleep before the pandemic predicts psychological distress. Method(s): Self-report data were analyzed from 3099 adolescents (9-10 years at baseline) in the population-based, demographically diverse, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study across three pre-pandemic annual visits and 3 monthly time points during the COVID-19 pandemic (ages 11-13 years). At each assessment, children and their guardians completed questionnaires including those about sleep, environment, and psychological wellbeing. Gradient Boosted Tree machine learning algorithms were used to identify the strongest predictors of pandemic-related psychological distress in individuals. We trained models using pre-pandemic sleep measures along with demographics, economic, and social measures during the pandemic. We evaluated the performance of the models using area under curve (AUC) metrics and interpreted the models by using the recently proposed SHapley Additive exPlanations methodology. Result(s): Pandemic-related perceived stress, fear and sadness were accurately detected with our classifiers (AUC = 0.83 for perceived stress, AUC = 0.73 for fear, AUC = 0.79 for sadness). Across all models, shorter sleep duration, prolonged sleep onset latency, and longer time between waking and getting out of bed predicted greater distress. Moreover, female sex, and pandemic-related factors, including greater family conflict, fewer economic resources, and more screen time contributed to prediction performance in all three models. Conclusion(s): Findings highlight the importance of addressing sleep problems and ensuring sufficient sleep duration in children to protect against the psychological impact of major life events, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the long-lasting effects of sleep, it would be crucial to improve sleep health by targeted prevention, intervention and increased awareness among adolescents.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:18Z,2022-08-24T07:29:18Z,NA,A90-A91,NA,SUPPL 2,44,NA,Sleep,NA,35th Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies.

Transitioning this technology from the lab to natural environments results in noisy data. Fortunately, advances in signal processing through Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made these technologies accessible to consumers. This study seeks to provide recommendations that address user preferences and concerns related to sleep self-management devices and software that leverage AI, as they have the potential to increase both the quantity and quality of sleep data available to researchers. Method(s): We assigned adult participants (N=25) with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores >= 5 (indicating low sleep quality) to one of four focus group sessions based on their self-reported prior use of sleep technologies. After a short demonstration, the moderator solicited participant feedback on devices and software in each of the following four categories: * headbands (Beddr, Dreem 2, Muse S) * sleep tracking mats (Withings) * snoring detectors (Smart Nora) * mobile applications (Sleep Cycle Alarm Clock, Sleep Score, Do I Snore, Sleep Rate) Results: Participants anticipated discomfort from wearing headbands and placing snoring detectors under their pillow, although a subset of participants indicated that they would be willing to sacrifice comfort in exchange for improved accuracy. Conversely, participants were interested in sleep tracking pads since they could passively collect sleep data without additional burden. Similarly, participants viewed mobile applications positively due to their ability to collect sleep data from a nightstand rather than being attached to the participant; however, there were concerns about remembering to activate these applications. Conclusion(s): Based on these results, we recommend using sleep tracking mats to collect patient-generated sleep data due to their ease of use and relative comfort, the main concerns related to lab-based sleep study participation. As a passive sensor, these require the least setup and support consistent data collection. Other devices run the risk of participants forgetting to use the device or becoming removed during the night resulting in missing data. By leveraging these existing technologies for remote sleep studies, researchers can increase recruitment and accessibility to promote sleep research participant diversity.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:18Z,2022-08-24T07:29:18Z,NA,A111,NA,SUPPL 2,44,NA,Sleep,NA,35th Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies.

PB is commonly identified in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), and portends a worse prognosis. Due to the impracticality of existing monitoring methods, no longitudinal data exist on whether individual patients may experience prognostically significant fluctuations in PB. Here, we present a novel tool enabling long-term in-home investigation of PB. By passively capturing respirations during sleep via mechanical sensors placed under the legs of a bed, the need for patient compliance is circumvented. PB events were identified by computing an amplitude modulation index, and features including respiratory rate, cycle length, and hyperpnea duration were extracted. To demonstrate viability for longitudinal studies, devices were installed in the homes of 25 CHF patients to continuously record respirations, 9 of whom were found to exhibit PB. In an illustrative case, ~15,000 cycles of PB were captured over 3 months in a patient discharged after hospitalization for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Bedscales documented the patient's worsening tachypnea accompanied by changes in PB parameters (shortened cycle and hyperpnea durations). A chest X-ray showed evidence of pneumonia and antibiotics were prescribed, after which tachypnea improved and trends of PB parameters reversed. This case highlights the potential utility of Bedscales in detecting subtle deviations from an individual's baseline respiratory signatures;future work is needed to assess the predictive power of these parameters. Taken together, theseresults demonstrate the feasibility of Bedscales as a low-cost, scalable tool for longitudinalpopulation-level studies of PB in relation to chronic diseases such as CHF.

Existing methods (such as peak-flow, diaries, and pulse oximetry) are limited by adherence and technique or confounded by subjectivity and recall bias. Nocturnal periods provide important signs in respiratory disease activity, yet accurate and unobtrusive methods for home monitoring are lacking. Current gold-standard tools - wearable polysomnography (PSG) devices - capture objective signs such as respiratory rate (RR) but require uncomfortable sensors, which are unsuitable for use beyond a few nights. Emerging monitoring solutions must minimize patient-burden to facilitate long-term engagement in clinical care and research. METHOD(S): In healthy adults, we evaluated accuracy of a passive, non-contact bedside device (Albus Home RD), that uses wireless motion sensors to capture RR, compared to gold-standard, wearable PSG (SOMNOtouchTM RESPIRATORY, Somnomedics). The table-top Albus Home RD was positioned on the bedside adjacent to the participant in their normal home bedroom environment. Participants slept with usual clothing and bedding; sleeping arrangements ranged from single- to king-size beds with single- and co-sleepers. Gold-standard PSG RR data were recorded using manual count of the raw respiratory traces derived from thoracoabdominal respiratory-effort belts. 10-minute periods from each hour of monitoring were chosen, where sufficient data were available and free from confounding movement and artefacts. Data from Albus Home RD were then analyzed using proprietary signal processing algorithms to output corresponding 30-second RR segments (as breaths/minute). RR results for each device for the selected periods were time-synchronized and compared for each 30-second segment. As per previous validation literature, accuracy was reported as proportion of RR measurements within +/-10% or +/-2 breaths/minute of the PSG RR. RESULT(S): 16 healthy adults (9 males, 7 females) participated in overnight monitoring; ages and BMI ranged 20-74 years and 19-38 respectively. Albus Home RD RR measurements for 1540 thirty-second segments were compared against the gold-standard with overall accuracy of 92.4%. Mean Absolute Percentage Error was 0.06 (SD=0.07). CONCLUSION(S): Albus Home RD passively measured RR with 92% accuracy in adults compared to gold-standard in 770 minutes of analysis. Using wireless sensors and proprietary signal processing algorithms, the Albus Home RD is a valid bedside, non-contact monitor of RR in real-world environments. The non-touch, passive nature of this monitor can enable low-burden, long-term home nocturnal monitoring. This system provides new possibilities for remote clinical care and objective data gathering in longitudinal research studies. .",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:18Z,2022-08-24T07:29:18Z,NA,NA,NA,9,203,NA,Am.

Although asthma is associated with poor sleep quality, studies have rarely included rural adolescents, who have significant asthma prevalence and morbidity. To address this, we examined associations between asthma and perceived sleep quality (PSQ) among rural adolescents. METHOD(S): This cross-sectional study used screening data from 723 9th - 12th graders from rural high schools participating in larger trial testing the effectiveness of an asthma intervention. Students reported if they were ever diagnosed with asthma and the past year symptom frequency; the latter was used to classify asthma based on NHLBI guidelines (intermittent VS persistent). We defined 'current asthma' as being diagnosed and having at least intermittent symptoms, and 'no asthma' as never being diagnosed and reporting no symptoms. Students reported the time they go to bed and wake on school nights, which was used to calculate the number of hours slept; they answered five PSQ questions from the 2007 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which we collapsed into three domains based on results of a principal component analysis: (a) trouble falling asleep; (b) waking at night/waking early and not being able to fall back asleep; and (c) feeling overly sleepy/unrested during the day. Using linear regression, controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, we examined the association between asthma status (current asthma VS no asthma) and PSQ, and among those with asthma between asthma severity and PSQ. RESULT(S): Overall, adolescents (mean age=16.3+/-1.2 years; 46% African American; 12% Latino; 54% male; 19% current asthma) slept on average 7.9 hours (SD=1.3) and reported signs of poor sleep quality (Table 1). As detailed in Table 1, compared to those without asthma, adolescents with current asthma slept significantly fewer hours and were significantly more likely to have trouble falling asleep, waking at night/waking early, and feeling overly sleepy/unrested during the day. Among those with asthma, adolescents with persistent symptoms were significantly more likely than those with intermittent symptoms to wake at night/wake early and feel overly sleepy/unrested. CONCLUSION(S): Rural adolescents slept fewer hours than recommended age-based guidelines (i.e., 8 - 10 hours). Consistent with urban youth, PSQ among rural adolescents was associated with current asthma and asthma severity. Medical providers treating rural adolescents with asthma could query rural adolescents about sleep quality, particularly if they have persistent asthma, to address these comorbid conditions. Researchers studying asthma or sleep quality should consider including both conditions. .",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:18Z,2022-08-24T07:29:18Z,NA,NA,NA,9,203,NA,Am. J. Respir. Crit.

Respiratory rate (RR) is an important and objective sign, yet is underutilized; no reliable methods for long-term monitoring exist. Current gold-standards-wearable polysomnography devices (PSG)-measure nocturnal RR using uncomfortable sensors such as effort belts and nasal cannulae and are suitable only for discrete, single-night recordings, particularly in children. In the post-COVID-19 era, reliable and accepted RR monitoring in the home will have significant potential for improving respiratory clinical care and research. METHOD(S): In a healthy pediatric population, we evaluated accuracy of a passive, non-contact bedside device (Albus Home RD) that uses wireless motion sensors to capture RR, as compared to a goldstandard, wearable PSG (SOMNOtouchTM RESPIRATORY, by Somnomedics). The table-top Albus Home RD was positioned adjacent to participants in their home bedroom environment. Sleeping conditions were normal and varied in bed-size, presence of bed-or room-sharers, clothing, and bedding. Gold-standard PSG RR data were recorded using manual count of the raw respiratory traces derived from thoracoabdominal respiratory-effort belts. 10-minute periods from each hour of monitoring were chosen, where sufficient data were available and free from confounding movement and artefacts.

However, the hr-RTLS alone does not provide the capability to differentiate patient ambulation from other forms of movement such as riding in a wheelchair or on a stretcher. The purpose of this project was to determine if merging data from a hr-RTLS (Ubisense, Cambridge) and a simultaneously worn actigraph would allow us to differentiate time when walking in the hospital from time when moving by other means. Method(s): A hr-RTLS was installed on one wing of the hospital. Project personnel wore RTLS tags while moving (either walking, being pushed in or self-propelling a wheelchair) along predetermined paths within the wing. Multiple movement segments of each movement type were conducted by multiple personnel. The start & end time, distance traveled, and mode of movement were accurately measured for each segment. The combined actigraph and RTLS data (8 measures/sec) along with the actual measurements were analyzed using machine learning to develop a formulation to predict mode of movement based on the RTLS and actigraph data alone. The accuracy of the resulting formulation was then determined. Result(s): Using the formulation developed based on analysis of the combined RTLS and actigraph data, we are able to differentiate the time periods of ambulation from periods of movement by other means (e.g., wheelchair) with an accuracy of 99.5% (sensitivity 99.5%, specificity 98.4%, PPV=95.8%, NPV=99.8%). Estimates of distance ambulated were within an average of 2.3% of actual. Conclusion(s): Based on analysis of the combined actigraph and hr-RTLS raw data, it was possible to determine when an individual was ambulating (as opposed to moving by other means such as riding in a wheelchair) to high degree of accuracy. This makes it possible to determine the time and distance an individual ambulates while in the hospital.",2021,2022-08-24T07:29:18Z,2022-08-24T07:29:18Z,NA,S78,NA,SUPPL 1,69,NA,J. Am. Geriatr.

Bedside point of care ultrasound helps in the rapid diagnosis of these manifestations. Vscan Extend (GE, Wauwatosa, WI, US) is a handheld ultrasound device with a dual probe and an artificial intelligence application to detect ejection fraction. It can help in reducing the time for diagnosis, duration, and number of HCW exposed to COVID-19. Objective(s): This is a prospective observational study comparing the cardiorespiratory parameters assessed by Vscan Extend with the conventional ultrasound machine. This evaluates the safety and accuracy of Vscan Extend and its utility in reducing the time duration for diagnosis. Material(s) and Method(s): Paired observations were made in 96 COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit by two intensivists. Intensivist A used the Vscan Extend device to assess the cardiac function, lung fields, diaphragm, deep veins, and abdomen. Intensivist B used routine investigation tools like clinical examination, X-ray chest, ECG, and conventional echocardiogram. The agreement between the findings and the time duration required in both the methods was compared. Result(s): The median duration of examination using handheld ultrasound was 9 (8.0-11.0) minutes, compared to 20(17-22) minutes with the conventional method (P < 0.001). The Cohen Kappa Coefficient was 1.0 for LV systolic function, most of the lung fields and diaphragmatic movement. Discussion(s): The use of handheld ultrasound has significantly decreased the time required for bedside examination of patients than the conventional method. The agreement was perfect between both the methods for systolic function, lung fields, and diaphragmatic movement. Conclusion(s): Vscan Extend handheld device helps in the rapid identification and diagnosis of cardiopulmonary manifestations in COVID-19 patients.

Method(s): Cognitive and 7-day/night actigraphy data were collected from people with HIV (PWH) and lifestyle-similar HIV-negative individuals from HIV and sexual health clinics in the United Kingdom/Ireland. A global cognitive T-score was obtained averaging the standardized individual cognitive test scores accounting for sociodemographics. Average and SD of 11 sleep measures over 7 days/nights were obtained. Rank regression, partial least-squares (PLS) regression, random forest, sleep dimension construct, and latent class analysis (LCA) were applied to evaluate associations between global T-scores and sleep measures. Result(s): In 344 PWH (median age 57 years, 86% males), average sleep duration, efficiency, and wake after sleep onset were not associated with global T-scores according to rank regression (p = 0.51, p = 0.09, p = 0.16, respectively). In contrast, global T-scores were associated with average and SD of length of nocturnal awakenings, SD of maintenance efficiency, and average out-of-bed time when analyzed by PLS regression and random forest. No associations were found when using sleep dimensions or LCA. Overall, findings observed in PWH were similar to those seen in HIV-negative individuals (median age 61 years, 67% males). Conclusion(s): Using multivariable analytical approaches, measures of sleep continuity, timing, and regularity were associated with cognitive performance in PWH, supporting the utility of newer methods of incorporating multiple standard and novel measures of sleep-wake patterns in the assessment of health and functioning.Copyright © 2021 Sleep Research Society 2021.

A data collection study was conducted with 20 healthy volunteers (10 males and 10 females, age = 43 +/- 13 years) in a simulated hospital environment. A single triaxial accelerometer mounted on the trunk was used to measure body movement and recognize six activity types: lying in bed, upright posture, walking, wheelchair transport, stair ascent and stair descent. A DNN consisting of a three-layer convolutional neural network followed by a long short-term memory layer was developed for this classification problem. Additionally, features were extracted from the accelerometer data to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for comparison. The DNN reached 94.52% overall accuracy on the holdout dataset compared to 83.35% of the SVM classifier. In conclusion, a DNN is capable of recognizing types of physical activity in simulated hospital conditions using data captured by a single tri-axial accelerometer.

Although BCGs cause less burden to the user, electrocardiograms (ECGs) are still commonly used in the clinical scene due to BCG sensors' noise sensitivity. In this paper, a robust method for sleep time BCG measurement and a mathematical model for predicting sleep stages using BCG are described. The novel BCG measurement algorithm can be described in three steps: preprocessing, creation of heartbeat signal template, and template matching for heart rate variability detection. The effectiveness of this algorithm was validated with 99 datasets from 36 subjects, with photoplethysmography (PPG) to compute ground truth heart rate variability (HRV). On average, 86.9% of the inter-beat intervals were detected and the mean error was 8.5ms. This shows that our method successfully extracted beat-to-beat intervals from BCG during sleep, making its usability comparable to those of clinical ECGs. Consequently, compared to other conventional BCG systems, even more accurate sleep heart rate monitoring with a smaller burden to the patient is available. Moreover, the accuracy of the sleep stages mathematical model, validated with 100 datasets from 25 subjects, is 80%, which is higher than conventional five-stage sleep classification algorithms (max: 69%). Although, in this paper, we applied the mathematical model to heart rate interval features from BCG, theoretically, this sleep stage prediction algorithm can also be applied to ECG-extracted heart rate intervals.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:19Z,2022-08-24T07:29:19Z,NA,NA,NA,19,20,NA,Sensors (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Switzerland Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed21&NEWS=N&AN=633136152,*ballistocardiography; *heart rate; *leg; *sleep stage; adult; algorithm; electrocardiography; female; human; male; photoelectric plethysmography; signal processing; theoretical model; young adult,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, in the future, it will be increasingly important to develop unobtrusive and transparent cardiac monitoring technologies for the population. The possible approaches are the development of wearable technologies or the integration of sensors in daily-life objects. We developed a smart bed for monitoring cardiorespiratory functions during the night or in the case of continuous monitoring of bedridden patients. The mattress includes three accelerometers for the estimation of the ballistocardiogram (BCG). BCG signal is generated due to the vibrational activity of the body in response to the cardiac ejection of blood. BCG is a promising technique but is usually replaced by electrocardiogram due to the difficulty involved in detecting and processing the BCG signals. In this work, we describe a new algorithm for heart parameter extraction from the BCG signal, based on a moving auto-correlation sliding-window. We tested our method on a group of volunteers with the simultaneous co-registration of electrocardiogram (ECG) using a single-lead configuration. Comparisons with ECG reference signals indicated that the algorithm performed satisfactorily. The results presented demonstrate that valuable cardiac information can be obtained from the BCG signal extracted by low cost sensors integrated in the mattress.

Using radar, heartbeat and respiration can be measured without contact and through clothing. By processing the raw radar data, the presence of a patient can be determined and movements are categorized into the classes ""bed exit"", ""bed entry"", and ""on bed movement"". Using this information, the vital parameters can be assessed in sections where the patient lies calmly in bed. In the first step, the presence and movement classification is demonstrated using recorded training and test data.

We previously demonstrated good performance of a real-time video-based algorithm for detection of nocturnal convulsive seizures in adults with learning disabilities. The algorithm calculates the relative frequency content based on the group velocity reconstruction from video-sequence optical flow. We aim to validate the video algorithm on nocturnal motor seizures in a pediatric population. We retrospectively analyzed the algorithm performance on a database including 1661 full recorded nights of 22 children (age = 3-17 years) with refractory epilepsy at home or in a residential care setting. The algorithm detected 118 of 125 convulsions (median sensitivity per participant = 100%, overall sensitivity = 94%, 95% confidence interval = 61%-100%) and identified all 135 hyperkinetic seizures. Most children had no false alarms; 81 false alarms occurred in six children (median false alarm rate [FAR] per participant per night = 0 [range = 0-0.47], overall FAR = 0.05 per night). Most false alarms (62%) were behavior-related (eg, awake and playing in bed). Our noncontact detection algorithm reliably detects nocturnal epileptic events with only a limited number of false alarms and is suitable for real-time use.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

The SSVEP paradigm was used to develop a system containing one main interface and five sub-interfaces corresponding to several devices during the working state, and one interface for the idle state. Participants controlled the devices by gazing at certain stimuli, which flickered at different frequencies for each function. Classical correlation analysis (CCA) of four channel EEG signals was used to recognize SSVEP features as intended selection. Several particular occlusal EMG patterns from the single channel of temporalis muscle were used to confirm the selected function, return from the sub-interface to the main interface, and switch the system on/off, respectively. Five healthy participants and five individuals with paralysis completed the system control experiment. The average target selection accuracy reached 97.5% and 83.6% in healthy participants and patients, while the confirmation accuracy in each group reached 97.6% and 96.9%, respectively. When SSVEPs were combined with EMG signals from occlusal movement to confirm the target selection, the actual control accuracy was maximized to 100%, and the information transmission rate (ITR) reached 45 bit/min among patients. Operation of the hBCI-based smart home control system did not cause higher mental or physical workload in patients compared to healthy participants. Our findings indicate that combining SSVEP and EMG signals effectively enhances the safety and interactivity of hBCI-based smart home systems.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:19Z,2022-08-24T07:29:19Z,NA,101687,NA,"(Chai, Zhang, Guan, Lu, Liu, Zhang, Niu) Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Biomedical Engineering, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China",56,NA,Biomed.

Method(s): Forty three infant polysomnography recordings were performed at 1-18 weeks of age, including a piezo element bed mattress sensor to record respiratory and gross-body movements. The hypnogram scored from polysomnography signals was used as the ground truth in training sleep classifiers based on 20,022 epochs of movement and/or electrocardiography signals. Three classifier designs were evaluated in the detection of deep sleep (N3 state): support vector machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory neural network, and convolutional neural network (CNN). Result(s): Deep sleep was accurately identified from other states with all classifier variants. The SVM classifier based on a combination of movement and electrocardiography features had the highest performance (AUC 97.6%). A SVM classifier based on only movement features had comparable accuracy (AUC 95.0%). The feature-independent CNN resulted in roughly comparable accuracy (AUC 93.3%). Conclusion(s): Automated non-invasive tracking of sleep state cycling is technically feasible using measurements from a piezo element situated under a bed mattress. Significance: An open source infant deep sleep detector of this kind allows quantitative, continuous bedside assessment of infant's sleep cycling.© Copyright © 2021 Ranta, Airaksinen, Kirjavainen, Vanhatalo and Stevenson.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:19Z,2022-08-24T07:29:19Z,NA,602852,NA,"(Ranta, Airaksinen, Vanhatalo) Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, BABA Center, Children's Hospital, Helsinki University Hospital and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland",14,NA,Front.

Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage is a key pathophysiological mechanism of amyloidal CSVD. Sleep plays a crucial role in keeping health of the central nervous system and in resistance to CSVD. The deficit of sleep contributes to accumulation of metabolites and toxins such as beta-amyloid in the brain and can lead to BBB disruption. Currently, sleep is considered as an important informative platform for diagnosis and therapy of AD. However, there are no effective methods for extracting of diagnostic information from sleep characteristics. In this review, we show strong evidence that slow wave activity (SWA) (0-0.5 Hz) during deep sleep reflects glymphatic pathology, the BBB leakage and memory deficit in AD. We also discuss that diagnostic and therapeutic targeting of SWA in AD might lead to be a novel era in effective therapy of AD. Moreover, we demonstrate that SWA can be pioneering non-invasive and bed-side technology for express diagnosis of the BBB permeability. Finally, we review the novel data about the methods of detection and enhancement of SWA that can be biomarker and a promising therapy of amyloidal CSVD and CSVD associated with the BBB disorders.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

We describe, here, the first field tests of two such methods, cStress and puffMarker, that were used to examine relationships between stress and smoking behavior and lapse from a sample of 76 smokers motivated to quit smoking. Participants wore a mobile sensors suite, called AutoSense, which collected continuous physiological data for 4 days (24-hours pre-quit and 72-hours post-quit) in the field. Algorithms were applied to the physiological data to create indices of stress (cStress) and first lapse smoking episodes (puffMarker). We used mixed effects interrupted autoregressive time series models to assess changes in heart rate (HR), cStress, and nicotine craving across the 4-day period. Self-report assessments using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of mood, withdrawal symptoms, and smoking behavior were also used. Results indicated that HR and cStress, respectively, predicted smoking lapse. These results suggest that measures of traditional psychophysiology, such as HR, are not redundant with cStress; both provide important information. Results are consistent with existing literature and provide clear support for cStress and puffMarker in ambulatory clinical research. This research lays groundwork for sensor-based markers in developing and delivering sensor-triggered, just-in-time interventions that are sensitive to stress-related lapser risk factors.Copyright © 2020",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:19Z,2022-08-24T07:29:19Z,NA,411-418,NA,"(Nakajima, Lemieux, al'Absi) Department of Family Medicine & Biobehavioral Health, University of Minnesota Medical School, Duluth, United States",158,NA,Int.

Accurately predicting nocturnal hypoglycemia before sleep may help minimize nighttime hypoglycemia. Method(s): A support vector regression (SVR) model was trained to predict, before bedtime, the overnight minimum glucose and overnight nocturnal hypoglycemia for people with T1D. The algorithm was trained on continuous glucose measurements and insulin data collected from 124 people (22,804 valid nights of data) with T1D. The minimum glucose threshold for announcing nocturnal hypoglycemia risk was derived by applying a decision theoretic criterion to maximize expected net benefit. Accuracy was evaluated on a validation set from 10 people with T1D during a 4-week trial under free-living sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy. The primary outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of prediction, the correlation between predicted and actual minimum nocturnal glucose, and root-mean-square error. The impact of using the algorithm to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia is shown in-silico. Result(s): The algorithm predicted 94.1% of nocturnal hypoglycemia events (<3.9 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval [CI], 71.3-99.9) with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.75-0.98). Correlation between actual and predicted minimum glucose was high (R = 0.71, P < 0.001). In-silico simulations showed that the algorithm could reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia by 77.0% (P = 0.006) without impacting time in target range (3.9-10 mmol/L). Conclusion(s): An SVR model trained on a big data set and optimized using decision theoretic criterion can accurately predict at bedtime if overnight nocturnal hypoglycemia will occur and may help reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia.Copyright © 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:20Z,2022-08-24T07:29:20Z,NA,801-811,NA,11,22,NA,Diabetes Technol.

The armband records three ECG channels, one electromyogram (EMG) channel, and tri-axial accelerometer signals. Contrary to conventional Holter monitors, the armband-based ECG device is convenient for long-term daily life monitoring because it uses no obstructive leads and has dry electrodes (no hydrogels), which do not cause skin irritation even after a few days. Principal component analysis (PCA) and normalized least mean squares (NLMS) adaptive filtering were used to reduce the EMG noise from the ECG channels. An artifact detector and an optimal channel selector were developed based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel using features that are related to the ECG signal quality. Mean HR was estimated from the 24-hour armband recordings from 16 volunteers in segments of 10 seconds each. In addition, four classical HR variability (HRV) parameters (SDNN, RMSSD, and powers at low and high frequency bands) were computed. For comparison purposes, the same parameters were estimated also for data from a commercial Holter monitor. The armband provided usable data (difference less than 10% from Holter-estimated mean HR) during 75.25%/11.02% (inter-subject median/interquartile range) of segments when the user was not in bed, and during 98.49%/0.79% of the bed segments. The automatic artifact detector found 53.85%/17.09% of the data to be usable during the non-bed time, and 95.00%/2.35% to be usable during the time in bed. The HRV analysis obtained a relative error with respect to the Holter data not higher than 1.37% (inter-subject median/interquartile range). Although further studies have to be conducted for specific applications, results suggest that the armband device has a good potential for daily life HR monitoring, especially for applications such as arrhythmia or seizure detection, stress assessment, or sleep studies.Copyright © 1964-2012 IEEE.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:20Z,2022-08-24T07:29:20Z,NA,3464-3473,NA,12,67,NA,IEEE Trans.

Despite curing millions, the currently used drug regimens are bounded by various limitations such as long course of therapy, emergence of resistance and permanent tissue damage. The treatment of multidrug-resistant and extremely drugresistant tuberculosis is a challenging task due to its reliance on second-line drugs which are less potent and more toxic than those used in the clinical management of drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Therefore, the major challenges in the upcoming years are to overcome the emergence of increased number of multidrug-resistant as well as extensively drug-resistant strains and the ineptness of the current treatment regimens against latent tuberculosis. Bedaquiline and Delamanid are the only new anti-TB drugs that have been currently approved since more than 40 years after discovery of isoniazid. Bedaquiline is the first diarylquinoline derivative that has showed resilient culture conversion at 24 weeks in phase IIb trials. Method(s): Extensive literature search on the topic was undergone using a focused question. Result(s): Fifty-eight research articles from journals of repute are included in the review. The vaccine and peptide-based conjugates are recent developments against Mycobacterium for selective and specific targeting to the desired tissues. Conclusion(s): In this review, we have focused on the different classes of chemical as well as plant based compounds as potent antitubercular agents against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis strains. This review falls light on the importance of research been undergoing in different parts of the world to combat the ever increasing problem of mycobacterial resistance and the various treatment options available for the treatment of tuberculosis.Copyright © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:20Z,2022-08-24T07:29:20Z,NA,13-23,NA,1,16,NA,Curr.

It manifests as inaccurate movements with delayed onset and overshoot, especially when movements are repetitive or rhythmic. Identification of ataxia is integral to the diagnosis and assessment of severity, and is important in monitoring progression and improvement. Ataxia is identified and assessed by clinicians observing subjects perform standardised movement tasks that emphasise ataxic movements. Our aim in this paper was to use data recorded from motion sensors worn while subjects performed these tasks, in order to make an objective assessment of ataxia that accurately modelled the clinical assessment. Method(s): Inertial measurement units and a Kinect© system were used to record motion data while control and ataxic subjects performed four instrumented version of upper extremities tests, i.e. finger chase test (FCT), finger tapping test (FTT), finger to nose test (FNT) and dysdiadochokinesia test (DDKT). Kinematic features were extracted from this data and correlated with clinical ratings of severity of ataxia using the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). These features were refined using Feed Backward feature Elimination (the best performing method of four). Using several different learning models, including Linear Discrimination, Quadratic Discrimination Analysis, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbour these extracted features were used to accurately discriminate between ataxics and control subjects. Leave-One-Out cross validation estimated the generalised performance of the diagnostic model as well as the severity predicting regression model. Result(s): The selected model accurately (96.4 %) predicted the clinical scores for ataxia and correlated well with clinical scores of the severity of ataxia (rho= 0.8 , p< 0.001). The severity estimation was also considered in a 4-level scale to provide a rating that is familiar to the current clinically-used rating of upper limb impairments. The combination of FCT and FTT performed as well as all four test combined in predicting the presence and severity of ataxia. Conclusion(s): Individual bedside tests can be emulated using features derived from sensors worn while bedside tests of cerebellar ataxia were being performed. Each test emphasises different aspects of stability, timing, accuracy and rhythmicity of movements. Using the current models it is possible to model the clinician in identifying ataxia and assessing severity but also to identify those test which provide the optimum set of data.

METHOD(S): We included 203 patients with BD, 54 UR and 109 HC in this study. To investigate whether smartphone-based sleep calculated from self-reported bedtime, wake-up time and screen on/off time reflected validated rating scales, we used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and sleep items on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item (HAMD-17) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). FINDINGS: (1) Self-reported smartphone-based sleep was associated with the PSQI and sleep items of the HAMD and the YMRS. (2) Automatically generated smartphone-based sleep measurements were associated with daily self-reports of hours slept between 12:00 midnight and 06:00. (3) According to smartphone-based sleep, patients with BD slept less between 12:00 midnight and 06:00, with more interruption and daily variability compared with HC. However, differences in automatically generated smartphone-based sleep were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION(S): Smartphone-based data may represent measurements of sleep patterns that discriminate between patients with BD and HC and potentially between UR and HC. CLINICAL IMPLICATION: Detecting sleep disturbances and daily variability in sleep duration using smartphones may be helpful for both patients and clinicians for monitoring illness activity.

Identifying patients at a high risk of SRPI is important for clinicians to recognize and prevent it expeditiously. Machine learning (ML) has been widely used in the field of healthcare and is well suited to predictive analysis. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to develop an ML-based predictive model for SRPI in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. METHOD(S): This secondary analysis of data was based on a single-center, prospective cohort analysis of 149 patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery. Data were collected from a 1,000-bed university-affiliated hospital. We developed the ML model using the XGBoost algorithm for SRPI prediction in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery based on major potential risk factors. Model performance was tested using a receiver operating characteristic curve and the C-index. RESULT(S): Of the sample of 149 patients, SRPI developed in 37, an incidence rate of 24.8%. The five most important predictors included duration of surgery, patient weight, duration of the cardiopulmonary bypass procedure, patient age, and disease category. The ML model had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.806, which indicates that the ML model has a moderate prediction value for SRPI. CONCLUSION(S): Applying ML to clinical data may be a reliable approach to the assessment of the risk of SRPI in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgical procedures. Future studies may deploy the ML model in the clinic and focus on applying targeted interventions for SRPI and related diseases.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Esophageal pressure manometry (EPM) based estimation of consecutive peak to trough differences (DELTAPes) is the gold standard method to quantify the severity of airway obstructions. However, the procedure is rarely available in sleep laboratories due to invasive nature. There is a clinical need for a simplified, scalable technology that can quantify the severity of airway obstructions. In this paper, we address this and propose a pioneering technology, centered on sleep related respiratory sound (SRS) to predict overnight DELTAPes signal. APPROACH: We recorded streams of SRS using a bedside iPhone 7 smartphone from subjects undergoing diagnostic polysomnography (PSG) studies and EPM was performed concurrently. Overnight data was divided into epochs of 10 s duration with 50% overlap. Altogether, we extracted 42181 such epochs from 13 subjects. Acoustic features and features from the two PSG signals serve as an input to train a machine learning algorithm to achieve mapping between non-invasive features and DELTAPes values. A testing dataset of 14171 epochs from four new subjects was used for validation. MAIN RESULTS: The SRS based model predicted the DELTAPes with a median of absolute error of 6.75 cmH2O (+/-0.59, r = 0.83(+/-0.03)). When information from the PSG were combined with the SRS, the model performance became: 6.37cmH2O (+/-1.02, r = 0.85(+/-0.04)). SIGNIFICANCE: The smart phone based SRS alone, or in combination with routinely collected PSG signals can provide a non-invasive method to predict overnight DELTAPes. The method has the potential to be automated and scaled to provide a low-cost alternative to EPM.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:20Z,2022-08-24T07:29:20Z,NA,105002,NA,10,41,NA,Physiol Meas,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United Kingdom Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed21&NEWS=N&AN=633375062,*airway obstruction/di [Diagnosis]; *devices; *sleep disordered breathing/di [Diagnosis]; *smartphone; acoustics; esophagus; human; manometry; polysomnography; pressure,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although the existing devices can detect data such as heart rate and the number of steps, they have been increasing the physical burden relying on long-term wearing. The purpose of this paper is to realize a noninvasive fine-grained home care monitoring system that is sustainable for people requiring special care. In the proposed method, we present a novel technique that integrates inexpensive camera devices and bone-based human sensing technologies to characterize the quality of in-home postural changes. We realize a local process in feature data acquisition once per second, which extends from a computer browser to Raspberry Pi. Our key idea is to regard the changes of the bounding box output by standalone pose estimation models in the shape and distance as the quality of the pose conversion, body movement, and positional changes. Furthermore, we use multiple servers to realize distributed processing that uploads data to implement home monitoring as a web service.

Our aim was to assess the distribution, determinants and predictors of physical activity (PA) levels using wrist-worn accelerometers in older patients hospitalized with acute medical illness. METHOD(S): Observational study conducted from February to November 2018 at an acute internal medicine unit in the University hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland. We enrolled 177 patients aged >=65years, able to walk prior to admission. PA during acute hospital stay was continuously recorded via a 3D wrist accelerometer. Clinical data was collected from medical records or by interview. Autonomy level prior to inclusion was assessed using Barthel Index score. PA levels were defined as <30mg for inactivity, 30-99mg for light and>=100 for moderate PA. Physically active patients were defined as 1) being in the highest quartile of time spent in light and moderate PA or 2) spending >=20min/day in moderate PA. RESULT(S): Median [interquartile range - IQR] age was 83 [74-87] years and 60% of participants were male. The median [IQR] time spent inactive and in light PA was 613 [518-663] and 63 [30-97] minutes/day, respectively. PA peaked between 8 and 10am, at 12am and at 6pm. Less than 10% of patients were considered physically active according to definition 2. For both definitions, active patients had a lower prevalence of walking aids and a lower dependency level according to Barthel Index score. For definition 1, use of medical equipment was associated with a 70% reduction in the likelihood of being active: odds ratio (OR) 0.30 [0.10-0.92] p =0.034; for definition 2, use of walking aids was associated with a 75% reduction in the likelihood of being active: OR=0.24 [0.06-0.89], p =0.032.

This study proposes an automatic fall risk prediction model based on eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB), using a data-driven approach to the standardized medical records. This study analyzed a cohort of 639 participants (297 fall patients and 342 controls) from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi Branch, Taiwan. A derivation cohort of 507 participants (257 fall patients and 250 controls) was collected for constructing the prediction model using the XGB algorithm. A comparative validation of XGB and the Morse Fall Scale (MFS) was conducted with a prospective cohort of 132 participants (40 fall patients and 92 controls). The areas under the curves (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the prediction models. This machine learning method provided a higher sensitivity than the standard method for fall risk stratification.

For instance, rising costs and lack of physicians are two serious problems affecting the patient's care. Nonintrusive monitoring of vital signs is a potential solution to close current gaps in patient monitoring. As an example, bed-embedded ballistocardiogram (BCG) sensors can help physicians identify cardiac arrhythmia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) nonintrusively without interfering with the patient's everyday activities. Detecting OSA using BCG sensors is gaining popularity among researchers because of its simple installation and accessibility, that is, their nonwearable nature. In the field of nonintrusive vital sign monitoring, a microbend fiber optic sensor (MFOS), among other sensors, has proven to be suitable. Nevertheless, few studies have examined apnea detection. Objective(s): This study aims to assess the capabilities of an MFOS for nonintrusive vital signs and sleep apnea detection during an in-lab sleep study. Data were collected from patients with sleep apnea in the sleep laboratory at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. Method(s): In total, 10 participants underwent full polysomnography (PSG), and the MFOS was placed under the patient's mattress for BCG data collection. The apneic event detection algorithm was evaluated against the manually scored events obtained from the PSG study on a minute-by-minute basis. Furthermore, normalized mean absolute error (NMAE), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were employed to evaluate the sensor capabilities for vital sign detection, comprising heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR). Vital signs were evaluated based on a 30-second time window, with an overlap of 15 seconds. In this study, electrocardiogram and thoracic effort signals were used as references to estimate the performance of the proposed vital sign detection algorithms. Result(s): For the 10 patients recruited for the study, the proposed system achieved reasonable results compared with PSG for sleep apnea detection, such as an accuracy of 49.96% (SD 6.39), a sensitivity of 57.07% (SD 12.63), and a specificity of 45.26% (SD 9.51). In addition, the system achieved close results for HR and RR estimation, such as an NMAE of 5.42% (SD 0.57), an NRMSE of 6.54% (SD 0.56), and an MAPE of 5.41% (SD 0.58) for HR, whereas an NMAE of 11.42% (SD 2.62), an NRMSE of 13.85% (SD 2.78), and an MAPE of 11.60% (SD 2.84) for RR. Conclusion(s): Overall, the recommended system produced reasonably good results for apneic event detection, considering the fact that we are using a single-channel BCG sensor. Conversely, satisfactory results were obtained for vital sign detection when compared with the PSG outcomes. These results provide preliminary support for the potential use of the MFOS for sleep apnea detection.Copyright © Ibrahim Sadek, Terry Tan Soon Heng, Edwin Seet, Bessam Abdulrazak.

An objective and quantitative means of passively monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is needed. Objective(s): We aim to explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)-base as a toolbox to rapidly test the effect and response to NPIs intended to limit the spread of COVID-19. Method(s): We analyzed data extracted from smartphone and wearable devices, and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We derived nine features on a daily basis including time spent at home, maximum distance travelled from home, the maximum number of Bluetooth-enabled nearby devices (as a proxy for physical distancing), step count, average heart rate, sleep duration, bedtime, phone unlock duration, and social app use duration. We performed Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post hoc Dunn tests to assess differences in these features among baseline, prelockdown, and during lockdown periods. We also studied behavioral differences by age, gender, BMI, and educational background. Result(s): We were able to quantify expected changes in time spent at home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices between prelockdown and during lockdown periods (P<.001 for all five countries). We saw reduced sociality as measured through mobility features and increased virtual sociality through phone use. People were more active on their phones (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), spending more time using social media apps (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), particularly around major news events. Furthermore, participants had a lower heart rate (P<.001 for Italy and Spain; P=.02 for Denmark), went to bed later (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), and slept more (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). We also found that young people had longer homestay than older people during the lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was no significant difference between the high and low BMI groups in time spent at home, the low BMI group walked more. Conclusion(s): RADAR-base, a freely deployable data collection platform leveraging data from wearables and mobile technologies, can be used to rapidly quantify and provide a holistic view of behavioral changes in response to public health interventions as a result of infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19. RADAR-base may be a viable approach to implementing an early warning system for passively assessing the local compliance to interventions in epidemics and pandemics, and could help countries ease out of lockdown.Copyright © Shaoxiong Sun, Amos A Folarin, Yatharth Ranjan, Zulqarnain Rashid, Pauline Conde, Callum Stewart, Nicholas Cummins, Faith Matcham, Gloria Dalla Costa, Sara Simblett, Letizia Leocani, Femke Lamers, Per Soelberg Sorensen, Mathias Buron, Ana Zabalza, Ana Isabel Guerrero Perez, Brenda WJH Penninx, Sara Siddi, Josep Maria Haro, Inez Myin-Germeys, Aki Rintala, Til Wykes, Vaibhav A Narayan, Giancarlo Comi, Matthew Hotopf, Richard JB Dobson, RADAR-CNS Consortium.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:20Z,2022-08-24T07:29:20Z,NA,e19992,NA,9,22,NA,J.

Polysomnography (PSG) is commonly used as a gold standard for evaluating sleep quality in children and adults. However, the intrusive nature of sensors used as part of PSG can themselves affect sleep and is, therefore, not suitable for children with ASD. In this study, we evaluate an unobtrusive and inexpensive bed system for in-home, long-term sleep quality monitoring using ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals. Using the BCG signals from this smart bed system, we define ""restlessness"" as a surrogate sleep quality estimator. Using this sleep feature, we build predictive models for daytime behavior based on 1-8 previous nights of sleep. Specifically, we use two supervised machine learning algorithms namely support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). For all daytime behaviors, we achieve more than 78% and 79% accuracy of correctly predicting behavioral issues with both SVM and ANN classifiers, respectively. Our findings indicate the usefulness of our designed bed system and how the restlessness feature can improve the prediction performance.Copyright © 2020 IPEM",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:20Z,2022-08-24T07:29:20Z,NA,15-25,NA,"(Alivar, Carlson, Suliman, Warren, Prakash, Thompson, Natarajan) Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS 66506, United States",83,NA,Med.

Early diagnosis reduces morbidity, mortality and cost, and diagnosis is often significantly delayed due to a lack of effective biomarkers. This research employs kernel density estimation (KDE) methods fusing a personalized, model-based insulin sensitivity (SI) metric with standard bedside measures of: temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and SIRS, as these measures are available hourly or more frequently. Method(s): Model-based SI is a derived metric, identified using clinical data and a clinically validated metabolic model. The KDE classifier discriminates severe sepsis and septic shock from moderate sepsis using accepted consensus sepsis scores. A best case in-sample estimate, a worst case independent cross validation estimate, and an accepted .632 bootstrap estimate are calculated to assess performance using multi-level likelihood ratios, and sensitivity and specificity. Performance is assessed against clinically and statistically defined thresholds denoted for the minimum acceptable level as: ""high accuracy, often providing useful information, and clinical significance,"" and similar definitions for greater or lesser quality. Result(s): The .632 bootstrap estimate performs near clinically defined levels of high accuracy, often providing useful information, and clinical significance based on sensitivity, specificity, and multilevel likelihood ratios. Conclusion and significance: The classifier created and this overall approach is useful for clinical decision making in diagnosing severe sepsis and septic shock in real time, for both case and control hours. However, improvements could be made with larger clinical data sets.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,NA,105295,NA,"(Parente, Moller) Institute of Technical Medicine, Furtwangen University, Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany",188,NA,Comput.

FEM - based numerical analysis is implemented to obtain the resulting contact pressure distribution. An example of person-seat interaction is analysed in this paper since plenty of experimental data set exists on this topic. A simplified geometrical model of the human body and seat is used and partly parameterized using a generic B-spline surface. The impact of the changes in geometry on the pressure distribution is analysed by the optimizer, and the seat geometry is steered into a shape with minimal high contact pressure areas. The procedure is general and can be adapted (with changes in geometry and boundary conditions) to distinct ergonomic problems such as footwear, therapeutic beds, automotive or aeronautical seating. The developed procedure can aid in virtual testing during the seat development phase in cases when the seat is designed for a selected population or for a single person and expected postural variations.Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,NA,945-958,NA,13,23,NA,Comput.

Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy may not always be preventable but it is believed that timely assistance with rescue medication and body re-positioning may overcome respiratory compromise in some cases. A novel algorithm based on a real time moving 9 s epoch, calculating 25 % percentage heart rate change and/or an oxygen saturation trigger level of <85 % was developed using photoplethysmography and incorporated into a prototype data storage device. Method(s): The algorithm was clinically evaluated in this multicentre trial in the detection of clinically significant epileptic seizures. A range of epileptic seizures and normal physiological events were recorded and classified by reference standard EEG Videotelemetry and time-synchronised event data recorded by the prototype device incorporating the pre-specified cut-off points prospectively and retrospective analysis of all events. Result(s): 119 participants who were attending electroencephalographic (EEG) videotelemetry as part of their clinical management of their epilepsy consented to take part in the trial. 683 epileptic seizures (77 clinically significant seizures) and 2648 normal physiological events were captured. When using pre-specified cut-off point 25 % heart rate change and/or oxygen desaturation <85 % on the basis of one/other, the device showed a sensitivity of 87 % for detecting clinically significant seizures. False Alarm Rate 4.5 (24 h FAR), detection latency of 58 s using heart rate percentage change. Conclusion(s): The results indicate that the novel algorithm can be used in detecting clinically significant seizures.Copyright © 2020 British Epilepsy Association",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,NA,109-117,NA,"(Brotherstone) Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, OPD15, Little France, Edinburgh, United Kingdom",82,NA,Seizure,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United Kingdom Publisher: W.B.

Desynchronized circadian rhythms may predispose individuals to disease or be indicative of underlying disease. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients likely experience desynchronized circadian rhythms due to disruptive environmental conditions in the ICU and underlying pathophysiology. This observational pilot study was undertaken to determine if 24-h rhythms are altered in ICU patients relative to healthy controls by profiling 24-h rhythms in vital signs and plasma metabolites. Method(s): We monitored daily rhythms in 5 healthy controls and 5 ICU patients for 24 h. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured every 30 min, temperature was measured every hour, and blood was sampled for mass spectrometry-based plasma metabolomics every 4 h. Bedside sound levels were measured every minute. Twenty-four hours rhythms were evaluated in vitals and putatively identified plasma metabolites individually and in each group using the cosinor method. Result(s): ICU patient rooms were significantly louder than healthy controls' rooms and average noise levels were above EPA recommendations. Healthy controls generally had significant 24-h rhythms individually and as a group. While a few ICU patients had significant 24-h rhythms in isolated variables, no significant rhythms were identified in ICU patients as a group, except in cortisol. This indicates a lack of coherence in phases and amplitudes among ICU patients. Finally, principal component analysis of metabolic profiles showed surprising patterns in plasma sample clustering. Each ICU patient's samples were clearly discernable in individual clusters, separate from a single cluster of healthy controls. Conclusion(s): In this pilot study, ICU patients' 24-h rhythms show significant desynchronization compared to healthy controls. Clustering of plasma metabolic profiles suggests that metabolomics could be used to track individual patients' clinical courses longitudinally. Our results show global disordering of metabolism and the circadian system in ICU patients which should be characterized further in order to determine implications for patient care.© Copyright © 2020 Lusczek, Parsons, Elder, Harvey, Skube, Muratore, Beilman and Cornelissen-Guillaume.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,NA,533915,NA,"(Lusczek, Skube, Muratore, Beilman) Department of Surgery, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States",11,NA,Front.

However, there are currently no standard microelectrode recording or macrostimulation methods to differentiate CM thalamus from other nearby structures and nuclei. Case Report: Here we present a case of failed conventional stereotactic targeting in TS DBS. Postopera-tive local field potential recordings (LFPs) showed features including beta power desynchronization during voluntary movement and thalamo-cortical phase amplitude coupling at rest. These findings suggested that the DBS lead was suboptimally placed in the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus rather than the intended CM region. Due to a lack of clinical improvement in tic severity scales three months following the initial surgery, the patient underwent lead revision surgery. Slight repositioning of the DBS leads resulted in a remarkably different clinical outcome. Afterwards, LFPs revealed less beta desynchronization and disappearance of the thalamo-cortical phase amplitude coupling. Follow-up clinical visits documented improvement of the patient's global tic scores. Discussion(s): This case provides preliminary evidence that combining physiology with atlas based targeting may possibly enhance outcomes in some cases of Tourette DBS. A larger prospective study will be required to confirm these findings. Highlight: This report demonstrates a case of failed centromedian nucleus region deep brain stimulation (DBS). We observed suboptimal tic improvement several months following DBS surgery and subsequent lead revision improved the outcome. The neurophysiology provided an important clue suggesting the possibil-ity of suboptimally placed DBS leads. Repeat LFPs during lead revision revealed less beta desynchronization and disappearance of the thalamo-cortical phase amplitude coupling. There was improvement in tic outcome following slight repositioning during bilateral DBS lead revision. This case provides preliminary evidence supporting the use of physiology to augment the atlas based targeting of Tourette DBS cases.Copyright © 2020, Center for Digital Research and Scholarship.

Apnoea often begets hypoxemia and/or bradycardia, and has the potential to result in adverse neurodevelopmental consequences. Our current inability to predict apnoeic events in preterm infants requires apnoea to first be detected by monitoring device/s in order to trigger an intervention by bedside (medical or nursing) staff. Such a reactive management approach is laborious, and makes the consequences of apnoeic events inevitable. Recent technological advances and improved signal processing have allowed the possibility of developing prediction models for apnoeic events in preterm infants. However, the development of such models has numerous challenges and is only starting to show potential. This paper identifies requisite components and current gaps in developing prediction models for apnoeic events, and reviews previous studies on predicting apnoeic events in preterm infants.© Copyright © 2020 Lim, Jiang, Marshall, Salmon, Gale and Dargaville.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,NA,570,NA,"(Lim, Marshall, Dargaville) Menzies Institute for Medical Research, College of Health and Medicine, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS, Australia",8,NA,Front.

We analyzed cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) in these children, a marker of sleep instability that might be associated with the motor episodes of RSD and may play a role in their daytime symptoms. Method(s): Polysomnographic recordings from thirty-eight children who fulfilled RSD diagnostic criteria (23 boys and 15 girls), 23 children with restless legs syndrome (RLS, 18 boys and 5 girls) and 19 controls (10 boys and 9 girls) were included. For CAP analysis, a previously developed, highly precise automated system, based on a deep learning recurrent neural network, was used. Result(s): Age and gender were not statistically different between groups. RSD patients showed a lower percentage of A3 CAP subtypes than controls (median 9.8 vs. 18.2, p = 0.0089), accompanied by shorter duration of the B phase of the CAP cycle (median 28.2 vs. 29.8 in controls, 30.2 in RLS, p = 0.005) and shorter CAP cycle duration than both controls and RLS subjects (median 33.8 vs. 35.0 in controls, 35.8 in RLS, p = 0.002). Finally, RSD children also showed a longer duration of CAP cycle sequences, when compared to controls (median 172.7 vs. 141.9, p = 0.0063). Conclusion(s): In conclusion, our study indicates that NREM sleep EEG shows an increased instability in RSD; these findings add to the current knowledge on the mechanisms of this newly recognized sleep disorder and suggest that sleep instability might be a favoring mechanism for the emergence of the motor episodes characterizing RSD.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,NA,276-281,NA,"(DelRosso, Ruth) Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, United States",75,NA,Sleep Med.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Netherlands Publisher: Elsevier B.V.

This presents a significant pain point for both the sufferers, and for healthcare systems, particularly in a post COVID-19 pandemic world. As such, it presents an opportunity for new technologies that can enable screening in both developing and developed countries. In this work, the performance of a non-contact OSA screener App that can run on both Apple and Android smartphones is presented. Method(s): The subtle breathing patterns of a person in bed can be measured via a smartphone using the ""Firefly""app technology platform [and underpinning software development kit (SDK)], which utilizes advanced digital signal processing (DSP) technology and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify detailed sleep stages, respiration rate, snoring, and OSA patterns. The smartphone is simply placed adjacent to the subject, such as on a bedside table, night stand or shelf, during the sleep session. The system was trained on a set of 128 overnights recorded at a sleep laboratory, where volunteers underwent simultaneous full polysomnography (PSG), and ""Firefly""smartphone app analysis. A separate independent test set of 120 recordings was collected across a range of Apple iOS and Android smartphones, and withheld for performance evaluation by a different team. An operating point tuned for mid-sensitivity (i.e., balancing sensitivity and specificity) was chosen for the screener. Result(s): The performance on the test set is comparable to ambulatory OSA screeners, and other smartphone screening apps, with a sensitivity of 88.3% and specificity of 80.0% [with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92], for a clinical threshold for the AHI of .15 events/ hour of detected sleep time. Conclusion(s): The ""Firefly""app based sensing technology offers the potential to significantly lower the barrier of entry to OSA screening, as no hardware (other than the user's personal smartphone) is required. Additionally, multi-night analysis is possible in the home environment, without requiring the wearing of a portable PSG or other home sleep test (HST).Copyright © 2020 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

With the advent of increased computational power and the ability to store and rapidly process big data sets in recent years, these physiologic data show promise in identifying specific outcomes and/or events during patients' ICU hospitalization. METHOD(S): We introduced a methodology designed to automatically extract information from continuous-in-time vital sign data collected from bedside monitors to predict if a patient will experience a prolonged stay (length of stay) on mechanical ventilation, defined as > 4 d, in a pediatric ICU. RESULT(S): Continuous-in-time vital signs information and clinical history data were retrospectively collected for 284 ICU subjects from their first 24 h on mechanical ventilation from a medical-surgical pediatric ICU at Boston Children's Hospital. Multiple machine learning models were trained on multiple subsets of these subjects to predict the likelihood that each of these subjects would experience a long stay. We evaluated the predictive power of our models strictly on unseen hold-out validation sets of subjects. Our methodology achieved model performance of >83% (area under the curve) by using only vital sign information as input, and performances of 90% (area under the curve) by combining vital sign information with subjects' static clinical data readily available in electronic health records. We implemented this approach on 300 independently trained experiments with different choices of training and hold-out validation sets to ensure the consistency and robustness of our results in our study sample. The predictive power of our approach outperformed recent efforts that used deep learning to predict a similar task. CONCLUSION(S): Our proposed workflow may prove useful in the design of scalable approaches for real-time predictive systems in ICU environments, exploiting real-time vital sign information from bedside monitors.

In prospective motion correction, the magnetic field gradients and radio frequency waveforms are adjusted in real time in response to measured head motion so as to maintain the head in a stationary reference frame relative to the scanner. Vital for this approach are accurate and rapidly sampled head pose measurements, which may be obtained optically using cameras. However, most optical methods are limited by the need to attach physical markers to the skin, which leads to decoupling of head and marker motion and reduces the effectiveness of correction. In this work we investigate the feasibility and initial performance of a stereo-optical motion tracking method which does not require any attached markers. Method(s): The method relies on detecting distinctive natural features or amplified features (using skin stamps) directly on the forehead in multiple camera views, and then deriving pose estimates via a 3D-2D registration between the skin features and a database of forehead landmarks. To demonstrate the feasibility and potential accuracy of the marker-free method for discrete (step-wise) head motion, we performed out-of-bore and in-bore experiments using robotically and manually controlled phantoms in addition to in-bore testing on human volunteers. We also developed a convenient out-of-bore test bed to benchmark and optimize the motion tracking performance. Result(s): For out-of-bore phantom tests, the pose estimation accuracy (compared to robotic ground truth) was 0.14 mm and 0.23 degrees for incremental translation and rotation, respectively. For arbitrary motion, the pose accuracy obtained using the smallest forehead feature patch was equivalent to 0.21 +/- 0.11 mm positional accuracy in the striatum. For in-bore phantom experiments, the accuracy of rigid-body motion parameters (compared to wireless MR-sensitive markers) was 0.08-0.41 +/- 0.18 mm/0.05-0.3 +/- 0.12 deg and 0.14-0.16 +/- 0.12 mm/0.08-0.17 +/- 0.08 deg for the small and large feature patches, respectively. In vivo results in human volunteers indicated sub-millimeter and sub-degree pose accuracy for all rotations and translations except the depth direction (max error 1.8 mm) when compared to a registration-based approach. Conclusion(s): In both bench-top and in vivo experiments we demonstrate the feasibility of using very small feature patches directly on the skin to obtain high accuracy head pose measurements needed for motion-correction in MRI brain studies. The optical technique uses in-bore cameras and is consistent with the limited visibility of the forehead afforded by head coils used in brain imaging. Future work will focus on optimization of the technique and demonstration in prospective motion correction.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Physicists in Medicine",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,NA,3321-3331,NA,8,47,NA,Med.

This review synthesizes the latest research on the development and application of 21 frailty measures for health care databases. Frailty measures varied widely in terms of target population (16 ambulatory, 1 long-term care, and 4 inpatient), data source (16 claims-based and 5 electronic health records [EHR]-based measures), assessment period (6 months to 36 months), data types (diagnosis codes required for 17 measures, health service codes for 7 measures, pharmacy data for 4 measures, and other information for 9 measures), and outcomes for validation (clinical frailty for 7 measures, disability for 7 measures, and mortality for 16 measures). These frailty measures may be useful to facilitate frailty screening in clinical care and quantify frailty for large database research in which clinical assessment is not feasible.Copyright © 2020 by The Korean Geriatrics Society.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,2022-08-24T07:29:21Z,NA,62-74,NA,2,24,NA,Ann.

This work aims to classify physically disabled people (deaf, dumb, and bedridden) and Autism children's emotional expressions based on facial landmarks and electroencephalograph (EEG) signals using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) classifiers by developing an algorithm for real-time emotion recognition using virtual markers through an optical flow algorithm that works effectively in uneven lightning and subject head rotation (up to 25degree), different backgrounds, and various skin tones. Six facial emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise) are collected using ten virtual markers. Fifty-five undergraduate students (35 male and 25 female) with a mean age of 22.9 years voluntarily participated in the experiment for facial emotion recognition. Nineteen undergraduate students volunteered to collect EEG signals. Initially, Haar-like features are used for facial and eye detection. Later, virtual markers are placed on defined locations on the subject's face based on a facial action coding system using the mathematical model approach, and the markers are tracked using the Lucas-Kande optical flow algorithm. The distance between the center of the subject's face and each marker position is used as a feature for facial expression classification. This distance feature is statistically validated using a one-way analysis of variance with a significance level of p < 0.01. Additionally, the fourteen signals collected from the EEG signal reader (EPOC+) channels are used as features for emotional classification using EEG signals. Finally, the features are cross-validated using fivefold cross-validation and given to the LSTM and CNN classifiers. We achieved a maximum recognition rate of 99.81% using CNN for emotion detection using facial landmarks. However, the maximum recognition rate achieved using the LSTM classifier is 87.25% for emotion detection using EEG signals.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,NA,100372,NA,"(Hassouneh, Mutawa) Computer Engineering Department, College of Engineering and Petroleum, Kuwait University, Kuwait",20,NA,Inform.

On the other hand, there is evidence that it should theoretically be beneficial for infants. One line of this evidence concerns breathing regulation, which at night is influenced by the rocking movement of the mother's chest as she breathes. Here, the hypothesis that mother-infant co-sleeping will be associated with a lower probability of infant breathing distress is tested in the UK Millennium Cohort Study (n = 18,552 infants). Maternal, infant, family, and socio-economic covariates were included in logistic regression analysis, and in a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) to make full use of the number of variables available in the birth cohort study data. Results from logistic regression analysis showed that co-sleeping was associated with a reduced risk of breathing difficulties (OR = 0.69, p = 0.027). The Random Forest algorithm placed high importance on socio-economic aspects of infant environment, and indicated that a number of maternal, child, and environmental variables predicted breathing distress. Co-sleeping by itself was not high in the Random Forest variable importance ranking. Together, the results suggest that co-sleeping may be associated with a modest reduction in risk of infant breathing difficulties.Copyright © 2020 by the author.

Increase in estrogen levels in women is known to promote reward probably mediated via the melanocortin and dopamine systems. Reduced estrogen in post-menopausal women attenuates reward, evoking the need for stimulation with greater rewarding salience. This is reflected in the well-recognized phenomena of difficulty in quitting and increased craving for nicotine in women following the onset of menopause. The present study aims at understanding the role of melanocortin receptors (MC-R) in nicotine-induced reward behavior following ovariectomy in rats. The MC4-R mRNA level was increased in ipsilateral nucleus accumbens (Acb) of the intact rats implanted with electrode in medial forebrain bundle and trained in intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) paradigm. Additional groups of ICSS trained rats were ovariectomized (OVX) and subjected to reward evaluation. Trained OVX rats revealed a significant increase in threshold frequency and rightward shift in rate frequency curve, suggesting reward deficit behavior. However, pre-administration with nicotine, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) or NDP-MSH (MC4-R agonist) to OVX animals restored the rewarding activity in ICSS protocol; HS014 (MC4-R antagonist) suppressed the lever press activity. Prior treatment with sub-effective doses of alpha-MSH or NDP-MSH potentiated the reward effect of nicotine, but was attenuated by HS014. Alpha-MSH-immunoreactivity was decreased in the Acb shell, arcuate and paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, and ventral bed nucleus of stria terminalis in the OVX rats, while nicotine treatment restored the same. We suggest a role for the endogenous MC system, perhaps acting via MC4-R, in the nicotine-induced reward in OVX rats.Copyright © 2020 IBRO",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,NA,205-221,NA,"(Upadhya, Choudhary, Subhedar) Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Dr. Homi Bhabha Road, Pashan, Pune, Maharashtra 411 008, India",431,NA,Neuroscience,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United Kingdom Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed21&NEWS=N&AN=2005114484,*brain depth stimulation; *melanocortin 4 receptor/ec [Endogenous Compound]; *nicotine; *protein function; *reward; adult; alpha intermedin/ec [Endogenous Compound]; amino acid sequence; animal experiment; animal model; arcuate nucleus; article; central nucleus (amygdala); complementary DNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]; controlled study; electrostimulation; female; frequency modulation; hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus; immunoreactivity; locomotion; messenger RNA/ec [Endogenous Compound]; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; nucleus accumbens shell; ovariectomy; priority journal; protein localization; rat; stria terminalis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Morning bright light advances circadian rhythms and could help adolescents fall asleep earlier. Morning bright light treatment before school, however, is difficult to fit into their morning schedule; weekends are more feasible. We examined phase advances in response to morning light treatment delivered over one weekend. Thirty-seven adolescents (16 males; 14.7-18.0 years) who reported short school-night sleep (<=7 h) and late bedtimes (school-nights >=23:00; weekend/non-school nights >=24:00) slept as usual at home for ~2 weeks (""baseline"") and then kept a fixed sleep schedule (baseline school-night bed and wake-up times +/-30 min) for ~1 week before living in the lab for one weekend. Sleep behavior was measured with wrist actigraphy and sleep diary. On Saturday morning, we woke each participant 1 h after his/her midpoint of baseline weekend/non-school night sleep and 1 h earlier on Sunday. They remained in dim room light (~20 lux) or received 1.5 or 2.5 h of intermittent morning bright light (~6000 lux) on both mornings. The dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), a phase marker of the circadian timing system, was measured on Friday and Sunday evenings to compute the weekend circadian phase shift. The dim room light and 1.5-h bright light groups advanced the same amount (0.6 +/- 0.4 and 0.6 +/- 0.5 h). The 2.5-h bright light group advanced 1.0 +/- 0.4 h, which was significantly more than the other groups. These data suggest that it is possible to phase advance the circadian clock of adolescents who have late bedtimes and short school-night sleep in one weekend using light that begins shortly after their sleep midpoint.© Copyright © 2020 Misiunaite, Eastman and Crowley.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,NA,99,NA,"(Misiunaite, Eastman, Crowley) Biological Rhythms Research Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, United States",14,NA,Front.

Recently, there are several illustrative examples whereby the translation of research had untoward outcomes requiring immediate action. Focus more on three-dimensional (3D) simulation, biomarkers, and artificial intelligence may allow orthopaedic surgeons to predict the ideal practices before orthopaedic surgery. Using the best medical imaging techniques may improve the accuracy and precision of tumor resections. This article is directed at young surgeon scientists and in particular orthopaedic residents and all other junior physicians in training to help them better understand TM and position themselves on career paths and hospital systems that strive for optimal TM. It serves to hasten the movement of knowledge garnered from the benchside and move it quickly to the bedside. Communication is ongoing in a bidirectional format. It is anticipated that more and more medical centers and institutions will adopt TM models of healthcare delivery.Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Pressure injuries should not occur in healthcare settings, and yet, they still affect 2.5 million patients in the United States and have an impact on quality of life. Pressure injuries come at a cost of 11 billion in the United States, and 90% of pressure injuries are a secondary condition. In this paper, we survey the literature on preventative techniques to address pressure injures, which we classify into two categories: active prevention strategies and sensor-based risk-factor monitoring. Within each category of techniques, we discuss the literature and assess each class of strategies based on its commercial availability, results of clinical trials when available, the ability for the strategy to save time for healthcare staff, and whether the technique can be tuned to an individual. Based on our findings, the most promising current solutions, supplementary to nursing guidelines, are electrical stimulation, pressure monitoring, and inertial measurement unit monitoring. We also find a need for a clinical software system that can easily integrate with custom sensors, use custom analysis algorithms, and provide visual feedback to the healthcare staff.Copyright © 2008-2011 IEEE.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,NA,352-368,NA,"(Mansfield, Obraczka) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, United States",13,NA,IEEE Rev.

Provide a basis for development. Method(s): A total of 34 HICH patients admitted to the hospital from January 2017 to December 2018 were included in the study. The patient was placed in the supine position with the head position raised by 0degree, 15degree, 30degree, 45degree, 0degree, and the interval between different body positions was 5 minutes. Each position was kept for 5 minutes, and the monitoring index values were read after stabilization. EGOS-600A near-infrared tissue blood oxygen parameters non-destructive monitor was used for bedside, dynamic and non-invasive real-time monitoring of rSO2; Codman intracranial pressure monitor was used for continuous dynamic monitoring of ICP; all patients were monitored with ICP and HPM-1205A ECG The monitor measures heart rate (HR), non-invasive blood pressure (BP), and pulse oximetry (SPO2). Result(s): When the bed angle of the patient was raised by 0degree, 15degree, 30degree and 45degree, the ICP value showed a decreasing trend with the elevation of the patient's bed angle. The ICP values were compared at various angles, and the difference was significant. Significance (P = 0.000); MAP value comparison, no significant difference (P = 0.074); CPP value showed an increasing trend with the elevation of the patient's bedside angle, the difference was significant, statistically significant (P = 0.000). There was no significant difference in HR values (P = 0.470). There was no significant difference in SPO2 values (P = 0.780). Conclusion(s): For patients with HICH with a GCS score of 5 to 12, multi-mode neurological monitoring, supine position elevation of 15degree~30degree is a relatively suitable position; HICH patients with NIRS for rSO2 non-invasive monitoring is very Necessary, and should pay more attention to cerebral blood oxygenation changes in patients undergoing medical care after tracheotomy; use multiple modes of monitoring to ensure that patients SaO2, PaO2, MAP, ICP, CPP, and RSO2 are within the normal range.

Researchers have yet to fully realize the potential of the large amount of data generated by these technology-based programs. Of particular interest is the ability to predict who will drop out of an intervention. This may be possible through the analysis of user journey data-self-reported as well as system-generated data-produced by the path (or journey) an individual takes to navigate through a digital health intervention. Objective(s): The purpose of this study is to provide a step-by-step process for the analysis of user journey data and eventually to predict dropout in the context of digital health interventions. The process is applied to data from an internet-based intervention for insomnia as a way to illustrate its use. The completion of the program is contingent upon completing 7 sequential cores, which include an initial tutorial core. Dropout is defined as not completing the seventh core. Method(s): Steps of user journey analysis, including data transformation, feature engineering, and statistical model analysis and evaluation, are presented. Dropouts were predicted based on data from 151 participants from a fully automated web-based program (Sleep Healthy Using the Internet) that delivers cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Logistic regression with L1 and L2 regularization, support vector machines, and boosted decision trees were used and evaluated based on their predictive performance. Relevant features from the data are reported that predict user dropout. Result(s): Accuracy of predicting dropout (area under the curve [AUC] values) varied depending on the program core and the machine learning technique. After model evaluation, boosted decision trees achieved AUC values ranging between 0.6 and 0.9. Additional handcrafted features, including time to complete certain steps of the intervention, time to get out of bed, and days since the last interaction with the system, contributed to the prediction performance. Conclusion(s): The results support the feasibility and potential of analyzing user journey data to predict dropout. Theory-driven handcrafted features increased the prediction performance. The ability to predict dropout at an individual level could be used to enhance decision making for researchers and clinicians as well as inform dynamic intervention regimens.Copyright ©Vincent Bremer, Philip I Chow, Burkhardt Funk, Frances P Thorndike, Lee M Ritterband.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,NA,e17738,NA,10,22,NA,J.

Prior research studied in-bed lying posture tracking using sensors of different modalities (e.g., accelerometer and pressure sensors). However, there remain significant gaps in research regarding how to design efficient in-bed lying posture tracking systems. These gaps can be articulated through several research questions, as follows. First, can we design a single-sensor, pervasive, and inexpensive system that can accurately detect lying postures? Second, what computational models are most effective in the accurate detection of lying postures? Finally, what physical configuration of the sensor system is most effective for lying posture tracking? To answer these important research questions, in this article we propose a comprehensive approach for designing a sensor system that uses a single accelerometer along with machine learning algorithms for in-bed lying posture classification. We design two categories of machine learning algorithms based on deep learning and traditional classification with handcrafted features to detect lying postures. We also investigate what wearing sites are the most effective in the accurate detection of lying postures. We extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms on nine different body locations and four human lying postures using two datasets. Our results show that a system with a single accelerometer can be used with either deep learning or traditional classifiers to accurately detect lying postures. The best models in our approach achieve an F1 score that ranges from 95.2% to 97.8% with a coefficient of variation from 0.03 to 0.05. The results also identify the thighs and chest as the most salient body sites for lying posture tracking. Our findings in this article suggest that, because accelerometers are ubiquitous and inexpensive sensors, they can be a viable source of information for pervasive monitoring of in-bed postures.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,NA,NA,NA,20,20,NA,Sensors (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Switzerland Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed21&NEWS=N&AN=633261073,*algorithm; *body position; *recurrent neural network; *short term memory; accelerometer; article; classifier; computer model; deep learning; human; injury; low back pain; prevention; sensor; sleep disordered breathing; thigh; thorax,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) with hundreds to thousands of source-detector pair measurements, motion detection methods are underdeveloped relative to both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and standard functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This limitation restricts the application of HD-DOT in many challenging imaging situations and subject populations (e.g., bedside monitoring and children). Here, we evaluated a new motion detection method for multi-channel optical imaging systems that leverages spatial patterns across measurement channels. Specifically, we introduced a global variance of temporal derivatives (GVTD) metric as a motion detection index. We showed that GVTD strongly correlates with external measures of motion and has high sensitivity and specificity to instructed motion-with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.88, calculated based on five different types of instructed motion. Additionally, we showed that applying GVTD-based motion censoring on both hearing words task and resting state HD-DOT data with natural head motion results in an improved spatial similarity to fMRI mapping. We then compared the GVTD similarity scores with several commonly used motion correction methods described in the fNIRS literature, including correlation-based signal improvement (CBSI), temporal derivative distribution repair (TDDR), wavelet filtering, and targeted principal component analysis (tPCA). We find that GVTD motion censoring on HD-DOT data outperforms other methods and results in spatial maps more similar to those of matched fMRI data.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

To date, risk scores for clinical deterioration applied to the acute care wards rely on static or intermittent inputs of vital sign and assessment parameters. We propose the use of continuous predictive analytics monitoring, or data that relies on real-time physiologic monitoring data captured from ECG, documented vital signs, laboratory results, and other clinical assessments to predict clinical deterioration. A necessary step in translation to practice is understanding how an alert threshold would perform if applied to a continuous predictive analytic that was trained to detect clinical deterioration. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the positive predictive value of 'risk spikes', or large abrupt increases in the output of a statistical model of risk predicting clinical deterioration. We studied 8111 consecutive patient admissions to a cardiovascular medicine and surgery ward with continuous ECG data. We first trained a multivariable logistic regression model for emergent ICU transfer in a test set and tested the characteristics of the model in a validation set of 4059 patient admissions. Then, in a nested analysis we identified large, abrupt spikes in risk (increase by three units over the prior 6 h; a unit is the fold-increase in risk of ICU transfer in the next 24 h) and reviewed hospital records of 91 patients for clinical events such as emergent ICU transfer. We compared results to 59 control patients at times when they were matched for baseline risk including the National Warning Score (NEWS). There was a 3.4-fold higher event rate for patients with risk spikes (positive predictive value 24% compared to 7%, p = 0.006). If we were to use risk spikes as an alert, they would fire about once per day on a 73-bed acute care ward. Risk spikes that were primarily driven by respiratory changes (ECG-derived respiration (EDR) or charted respiratory rate) had highest PPV (30-35%) while risk spikes driven by heart rate had the lowest (7%). Alert thresholds derived from continuous predictive analytics monitoring are able to be operationalized as a degree of change from the person's own baseline rather than arbitrary threshold cut-points, which can likely better account for the individual's own inherent acuity levels. Point of care clinicians in the acute care ward settings need tailored alert strategies that promote a balance in recognition of clinical deterioration and assessment of the utility of the alert approach.Copyright © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,2022-08-24T07:29:22Z,NA,797-804,NA,4,34,NA,J.

Artificial intelligence is poised to assist in management of this complex population. Method(s): We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms collected from 45 neonates after the Norwood procedure. Waveforms from the first two postoperative days (critical) and the day prior to transfer out of the ICU (stable) were used for training. The model was validated on 10 post-Norwood neonates. Models were compared to traditional machine learning algorithms on non-waveform data, heart rate variability, and then combined in a final model to optimize performance. Retrospective clinical observation scoring was completed for comparison. Result(s): The CNN model on 3-lead ECG yielded an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) of 0.97 (0.02). The final model combining predictions from the CNN, random forest on vital signs, and logistic regression on pH, lactic acid, and base deficit values achieved 0.98 (0.02). Retrospective clinical observations agreed with the final model 78% of the time.

We collected a unique dataset of voice and accelerometer samples from 584 people living with ALS (542 participants contributed 5814 voice samples, and 350 contributed 13,009 accelerometer samples) over four years. At regular intervals, the participants spoke a single phrase and carried out exercises with their four limbs, tracked with accelerometers. We created and validated two categories of machine learningbased models based on these data, one for voice and the other for accelerometer recordings. The voice models achieved an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.847-0.884) for predicting bulbar-related FRS scores (speaking). The accelerometer models achieved a median AUC of 0.73 across 6 limb-related function scores (e.g. climbing stairs, handwriting, turning in bed).

Currently behavioural assessments rely on subjective, inaccurate, discontinuous human observations. Whilst recent research has focused on using wearable activity meters (e.g. step counters), these have to date been unable to classify reliably activity patterns in patients. Our group have developed a behavioural-biomarkers method that relates patterns of multi-limb motion data to activity classes and disability. Here we tested the feasibility and validity of this approach in a stroke population. Method(s): We conducted a prospective observational study in stroke in-patients. We collected freeliving movement data from 4 x inertial movement units worn on ankles and wrists and ground truth video. We compared Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Convolutional Neural Networks for classification of 5 behaviours {lying, sitting-up in bed, sitting on edge of bed or chair, standing, walking} using leave 1-out validation tests for each subject. Result(s): The best performing model was the Convolutional Neural Network which predicted 5 activities with >85% accuracy in over 88 hours of free-living movement recorded from 35 patients (17 females and 18 males; median age in years: 61 (range: 31-80); median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale: 3 (range: 0-18)). Additionally, over 90% of in-patients (n=44) strongly or somewhat agreed that the sensors were easy to use, comfortable, did not cause anxiety, and did not limit daily activities. Conclusion(s): An AI-based system of multi-limb smartwatches can provide an accurate and acceptable way of quantifying common behavioural states in free-living stroke in-patients.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:23Z,2022-08-24T07:29:23Z,NA,147,NA,1 SUPPL,15,NA,Int.

Prechtl's general movements assessment (GMA) allows visual recognition of movement patterns that, when cramped synchronized (CS) have high specificity in predicting neuromotor disorders. However, challenges inherent to various healthcare settings and to the rigorous GMA training process have hindered universal adoption in the newborn period. Our team focused on developing an automated tool to accurately read GMA in the NICU near term equivalent age. We hypothesized that a combination of pressure sensor technology and machine learning could develop an easy, rapid tool for clinical use. Study Design Prospective observational study with a simultaneously obtained derivation and validation cohort. Study Participants & Setting In a large tertiary care NICU, we consecutively recruited 375 infants. Included infants were 36 to 44 weeks postconceptional age regardless of diagnosis (range was extreme prematurity to mild jaundice). Excluded infants were on ventilators or had orthopedic conditions precluding movement. Materials/Methods We simultaneously recorded supine infants in their NICU beds moving for ~2 minutes on a flexible fabric pressure sensor mat and on standard video. Masked observers with advanced GMA training classified the videos. The mat allowed collection pressure data with spatial and time coordinates in a 32X32 matrix. To classify mat data, we considered features extracted from automatic machine-learning tools, and in parallel, clinician-designed features such as calculated pressure centers and distances. Periods of rest were subtracted from recordings via a filter for variability of movement. Because we predicted categorical outcome (CS vs not) with labeled data, the following models were compared: Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Kneighbors, Ensemble and SVM classifiers. Results Video GMAs were coded as 34% normal writhing, 62% poor repertoire and 4% CS. Algorithms using computer-generated features rapidly differentiated normal from abnormal movements with 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity. However, they were unable to differentiate PR from CS movements more than random chance. Using a supervised learning method with a Leave-one-out cross-validation model and the set of 40 clinician-designed features, we were able to differentiate CS movements from all others (Table 1). SVM had the best fit in allowing a clinically meaningful readout. The user interface leveraging this set of features and model was then validated in clinical practice and allowed a readout <15 minutes after data collection in the NICU. Conclusions/Significance A pressure sensor mat with a practical interface and a machine learning algorithm with clinician-designed features, rapidly identifies those infants with CS movements who could most benefit from neuroimaging and close neurodevelopmental surveillance.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:23Z,2022-08-24T07:29:23Z,NA,87,NA,SUPPL 3,62,NA,Dev.

Children and community health workers are not always available to address the needs and difficulties of their daily activities, when a treatment and cure measure is lack which can cause a severe result even death. Health and safety monitoring of single-resided elder is a continuous and slow process, which needs to establish a stable intelligent monitoring mode. Based on the sensor network to understand the daily life behavior, the dynamic behavior monitoring method of constructing the living scene of single-resided elder may change this situation. Method(s): In this paper, six fixed cameras are set in the experimental scene to collect video data, and the nursing of single-resided elder is taken as an example, the experimenter moved freely in the scene and performed daily activities in a natural state, examples include 'drinking from a cup', 'remote control TV', 'sleeping in bed', 'falling out of bed ', and 'falling while walking'. Through the process of collecting different samples, the model algorithm is tested and the results are analyzed based on the data. Signal processing based on captured video data completes the track calculation, human body tracking, human posture estimation, human motion recognition, human-object interaction recognition, human-environment interaction recognition and other features extraction, on this basis, reasoning and recording multi-level situation information and behavior understanding results. The abnormal behavior can be judged according to the reasoning result, and the behavior feedback of automatic rescue and alarm can be made quickly to ensure the safety and health of single-resided elder. Result(s): The experimental method is tested on different video clips, including 10 video clips with a frame rate of 24 frames per second and a length of 3000-5000 frames. After testing, this method can realize the daily life behavior monitoring of the old people living alone from different angles. Simultaneous on-line reasoning of multi-level action recognition and behavior analysis in daily life scenes in multiple situation states, these include motion recognition methods that tolerate changes in perspective and distance, daily life behavior analysis models that support the computation of awareness of multiple situations, and online reasoning methods in the application of layered dynamic Bayesian network for single-resided elder, high recognition accuracy is obtained. Conclusion(s): The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively realize the joint on-line reasoning of multi-level human states in daily life scenes, and achieve a highly recognition rate. At the same time, by adjusting the parameters and observation characteristics of the experiment method, it can be applied to more daily activities of reasoning and analysis, with good universality and expansion.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:23Z,2022-08-24T07:29:23Z,NA,76-77,NA,SUPPL 1,127,NA,Basic Clin.

However, PET image quality and diagnostic value is reduced if motion occurs during acquisition, which is manifested by blurring and inaccurate quantitation. With low dose imaging, motion management is a key issue due to the need for extended acquisition times. Proposed solutions for motion management in PET brain imaging include image registration techniques (which suffer from low temporal resolution, and are incompatible with low dose protocols), MR-data driven approaches (which require a simultaneous PET/MR scanner, and also interfere with availability of MR for simultaneous diagnostic imaging), and external tracking systems (which require integration of an external tracking system). In this work, we apply an optical camera tracking system to demonstrate the capability of low dose PET brain imaging with motion management using list mode reconstruction. Method(s): One subject was scanned on a GE SIGNA PET/MR system (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). Motion tracking was performed with an optical camera system (HobbitView Inc., San Jose, CA) attached to the 8-channel head coil. A curved marker with unique labels was placed on the subject's forehead to capture rigid motion (6 degrees of freedom: translations and rotations). A time of flight (TOF) PET scan was acquired in the head for approximately ten minutes (632 seconds). TOF-OSEM image reconstruction was performed using GE Healthcare's list mode reconstruction software in MATLAB (R2018b, Mathworks, Natick, MA) with standard clinical settings. List mode PET data was retrospectively sub-sampled to 25%, 10%, 5%, and 1% of the original counts by strided sub-sampling across the ten minute dataset (rather than taking continuous, short-duration portions of list mode data). Reconstructions were performed with and without the application of motion correction (motion transforms estimated from external camera applied to correct individual lines of response). Result(s): For a 10-minute PET bed in which the subject was instructed to hold still, a maximum of 1.5 degrees of rotation and 4 mm of displacement was observed. Large rotations and translations correlated with start and stop times of MR sequences, while small periodic motions related to respiration are observed in between. Full dose uncorrected PET images were slightly blurry compared to motion corrected (MC) images, but were still diagnostic. Qualitatively, uncorrected images showed poor gray/white contrast as dose was reduced, while contrast and features were preserved with the application of MC. Average root mean squared error (RMSE) of PET values in brain, relative to full dose MC, were 1.705 x103 Bq/cc for 25% dose, 3.014 x103 Bq/cc for 10%, 4.536 x103 Bq/cc for 5%, and 9.913 x103 Bq/cc for 1% with MC applied. In comparison, the RMSE of uncorrected images was 4.480 x103 Bq/cc for 100% dose, 4.785 x103 Bq/cc for 25% dose, 5.252 x103 Bq/cc for 10% dose, 5.918 x103 Bq/cc for 5% dose, and 10.129 x103 Bq/cc for 1% dose. Peak signal to noise ratios (PSNR) for MC images were 0.9540 for 25%, 0.8827 for 10%, 0.7981 for 5%, and 0.5062 for 1%. PSNRs of uncorrected images were 0.8175 for 25%, 0.7672 for 10%, 0.7090 for 5%, and 0.4924 for 1%. Conclusion(s): To realize the full potential of low dose PET imaging, a system of motion management is necessary due to increased examination times. By integrating an optical tracking system, motion can be managed in a robust way. Future development of low dose imaging is likely to benefit from the application of deep learning algorithms. However, these approaches are unlikely to be successful without the integration of motion data. Therefore, retrospective motion correction enabled by using event-byevent list mode reconstruction, can enable the best quality low dose images, which is able to efficiently use all counts in reconstruction.

We analyzed cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) in these children, a marker of sleep instability that might be associated with the motor episodes of RSD and may play a role in their daytime symptoms. Method(s): Polysomnographic recordings from thirty-eight children who fulfilled RSD diagnostic criteria (23 boys and 15 girls), 23 children with restless legs syndrome (RLS, 18 boys and 5 girls) and 19 controls (10 boys and 9 girls) were included. For CAP analysis, a previously developed, highly precise automated system, based on a deep learning recurrent neural network, was used. Result(s): Age and gender were not statistically different between groups. RSD patients showed a lower percentage of A3 CAP subtypes than controls (median 9.8 vs. 18.2, p=0.0089), accompanied by shorter duration of the B phase of the CAP cycle (median 28.2 vs. 29.8 in controls, 30.2 in RLS, p=0.005) and shorter CAP cycle duration than both controls and RLS subjects (median 33.8 vs. 35.0 in controls, 35.8 in RLS, p=0.002). Finally, RSD children also showed a longer duration of CAP cycle sequences, when compared to controls (median 172.7 vs. 141.9, p=0.0063). Conclusion(s): In conclusion, our study indicates that NREM sleep EEG shows an increased instability in RSD; these findings add to the current knowledge on the mechanisms of this newly recognized sleep disorder and suggest that sleep instability might be a favoring mechanism for the emergence of the motor episodes characterizing RSD.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:23Z,2022-08-24T07:29:23Z,NA,A358,NA,SUPPL 1,43,NA,Sleep,NA,"34th Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies.

In the context of dementia care, sensors can be wearable and used to measure movement, location, various physiological markers, and environmental exposures (light,sound, temperature). Sensors in beds can be used to assess physiological measures of sleep. Sensors are also often embedded in the environment to track movement and interactions within the milieu (ie opening of doors, turning on taps). Finally, computer vision-based sensors are able to ""watch"" for facial expressions and posture. Importantly, to transform sensor data into clinically useful information it is necessary to find important features and patterns in the data. This process is termed data mining, and often involves modeling using advanced machine learning. The aim is to develop a system capable of capturing clinically meaningful information, and capable of using this real-time data to provide warnings or make predictions that have a meaningful impact on clinical decision-making or patient care. In this session, we will be presenting research on the use of different kinds of sensor data for the assessment and monitoring of behavioural and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD).

The IDEAs study aimed to determine the sleep, physical and circadian pathologies in pts during their daily routine at home, which could lower I < O and be modifiable through personalised interventions. Method(s): The rest-activity and surface temperature patterns were monitored in real time using a tele-transmitting chest sensor and a GPRSplatform for one week in 25 pts, with a WHO performance status of 0-1 and metastatic GIC (colorectal, 56%). Each pt completed questionnaires including Chronotype, HADS, and Pittsburgh Sleep Index, filled a precise diary of daily activities, meals and sleep times, and the MD Anderson Symptoms Inventory daily. I < O counts the In-bed activity bouts per min that are below the median activity Out-ofbed. Other pt-specific circadian parameters were estimated with spectral analyses and Hidden Markov models (HMM). I < O predictors were identified through correlation and regression analyses. Result(s): A poor I < O was found for 13 pts (52%). Self-reported scores for sleep quality or physical fitness showed no significant differences according to I < O. Yet HMM-modelled rest-activity revealed that pts with poor I < O had lower activity out-of-bed (median activity counts per minute, 110 vs 52, p = 0.001) and fractionated sleep (probability of remaining at rest when asleep, 94% vs 90%, p = 0.01). Poor I < O was significantly associated with an abnormal circadian rhythm in chest surface temperature, that was either wrongly timed or suppressed, for 83% of the pts as compared to 25% of those with a good I < O (p = 0.012). Conclusion(s): Nearly half of the pts displayed altered circadian rest-activity rhythm, with poor sleep and low daytime activity. In most of them, the circadian rhythm in body temperature, which critically regulates sleep, was abnormal.

Smooth and controlled solid circulation is the key to the successful operation of the chemical looping system. Bridging or arching, which may occur in the moving bed standpipe of the system, caused by a combination of fines accumulation and gas flows, is a major impediment to the smooth solid circulation and can lead to the failure of the entire system operation. Thus, early detection of the tendency of bridging or arching is important. This paper describes a model that applies the long short-term memory based recurrent neural network scheme to detect the tendency of arching in the standpipe of a chemical looping system. The arching tendency can be ascertained by early detection of the bubble formation in the standpipe. The bubble movement or local fluidization is recognized to precede the arching formation due to local accumulation of fine particles generated from coarse particle attrition. The early detection of the bubbles thus renders it possible to prevent arching through the prompt action of fines removal from the system. In this study, the recurrent neural network model which detects the fines induced fault manifested as bubbles in the standpipe is developed. It is over the data generated from an experimental sub-pilot scale, cold-flow chemical looping unit. To improve the robustness of the diagnosis, a number of networks with different structures are considered, and an ensemble decision strategy is used to conduct the diagnosis. The recall value obtained of the diagnosed result, which represents the extent of the fraction of real bubbles that are detected, can reach higher than 86.7%. This result reflects a good accuracy of the recurrent neural network model in the fault detection for the chemical looping system.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2022-08-24T07:29:23Z,2022-08-24T07:29:23Z,NA,266-276,NA,"(Pan, Pottimurthy, Wang, Hwang, Patil, Fan) William.

Our study was part of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of bed and bedside chair pressure sensors linked to radio pagers to prevent bedside falls in older people admitted to hospital. We use agential realism within science and technology studies to examine the fall and its prevention as a situated phenomenon of knowledge that is made and unmade through intra-actions between environment, culture, humans and technologies. We show that neither the intervention (the pressure sensor system), nor the outcome (fall prevention) could be disentangled from the broader sociomaterial context of the ward, the patients, the nurses and (especially) their work through the RCT. We argue that the RCT design, by virtue of its unacknowledged assumptions, played a part in creating the negative findings. The study also raises wider questions about the kind of subjectivities, agencies and power relations these entanglements might effect and (re)produce in the hospital ward.Copyright © 2019 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:24Z,2022-08-24T07:29:24Z,NA,1104-1119,NA,6,41,NA,Sociol Health Illn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United Kingdom Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed20&NEWS=N&AN=628622016,*devices; *nursing; *patient safety; *prevention and control; aged; controlled study; falling; hospital; human; physiologic monitoring; randomized controlled trial; very elderly,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the feasibility study, 12 AF patients' data were recorded during entire night of sleep. Each BCG recording was split into nonoverlapping 30s epochs labeled either AF or normal. Using the features extracted from stationary wavelet transform of these epochs, three popular machine learning classifiers (support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, and ensembles) have been trained and evaluated on the set of 7816 epochs employing 30% hold-out validation. The results showed that all the trained classifiers could achieve an accuracy rate above 91.5%. The optimized ensembles model (Bagged Trees) could achieve accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.944, 0.970 and 0.891, respectively.

According to the decision made by VGG-19, subsets of the image data are next passed to one of four dedicated sub-class CNNs. As a result, the pose estimation label is further refined from one of four sleep pose labels to one of 12 sleep pose labels. 10 participants contributed for recording infrared (IR) images of 12 pre-defined sleep positions. Participants were covered by a blanket to occlude the original pose and present a more realistic sleep situation.

However, many apps struggle with getting readings that are accurate enough to estimate heart rate variability (HRV) one of the most popular biomarkers in the preventive health space. The main obstacle is the multitude of factors that impact PPG results: unique technical characteristics of different smartphone models, frames per second (FPS) rate and the way color is recoarded, brightness and ambient flash levels, finger placement, in-measurement movement, etc. These factors may decrease the accuracy of the signal extracted from the camera's video stream and produce additional errors in the computation of HRV parameters.

Fourteen patients completed PSG sleep studies for one night with simultaneous recording from our load-cell-based sensing device in the bed. Subjects subsequently installed pressure sensors in their bed at home and recorded signals for up to four nights. Machine learning models were optimized to classify sleep apnea severity using a standardized American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) scoring of the gold standard studies as reference. On a per-night basis, our model reached a correct OSA detection rate of 82.9% (sensitivity = 88.9%, specificity = 76.5%), and OSA severity classification accuracy of 74.3% (61.5% and 81.8% correctly classified in-clinic and in-home tests, respectively).

Rapid diagnosis and initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is the cornerstone of therapy for victims of cardiac arrest. Yet a significant fraction of cardiac arrest victims have no chance of survival because they experience an unwitnessed event, often in the privacy of their own homes. An under-appreciated diagnostic element of cardiac arrest is the presence of agonal breathing, an audible biomarker and brainstem reflex that arises in the setting of severe hypoxia. Here, we demonstrate that a support vector machine (SVM) can classify agonal breathing instances in real-time within a bedroom environment. Using real-world labeled 9-1-1 audio of cardiac arrests, we train the SVM to accurately classify agonal breathing instances. We obtain an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9993 +/- 0.0003 and an operating point with an overall sensitivity and specificity of 97.24% (95% CI: 96.86-97.61%) and 99.51% (95% CI: 99.35-99.67%).

We also evaluate our classifier in home sleep environments: the false positive rate was 0-0.22% over 164 h (236,666 audio segments) of sleep data collected across 35 different bedroom environments. We prototype our proof-of-concept contactless system using commodity smart devices (Amazon Echo and Apple iPhone) and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying cardiac arrest-associated agonal breathing instances played over the air.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:24Z,2022-08-24T07:29:24Z,NA,52,NA,1,2,NA,npj Digit.

Countermeasures and work scheduling designs aimed at mitigating fatigue are typically evaluated in controlled laboratory environments, but the effectiveness of translating such strategies to operational environments can be challenging to assess. This manuscript summarizes an approach for collecting sleep, circadian, fatigue, and performance data in a complex operational environment. We studied 44 airline pilots over 34 days while they flew a fixed schedule, which included a baseline data collection with 5 days of mid-morning flights, four early flights, four high-workload mid-day flights, and four late flights that landed after midnight. Each work block was separated by 3-4 days of rest. To assess sleep, participants wore a wrist-worn research-validated activity monitor continuously and completed daily sleep diaries. To assess the circadian phase, pilots were asked to collect all urine produced in four or eight hourly bins during the 24 h after each duty block for the assessment of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s), which is a biomarker of the circadian rhythm. To assess subjective fatigue and objective performance, participants were provided with a touch-screen device used to complete the Samn-Perelli Fatigue Scale and Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) during and after each flight, and at waketime, mid-day, and bedtime. Using these methods, it was found that sleep duration was reduced during early starts and late finishes relative to baseline. Circadian phase shifted according to duty schedule, but there was a wide range in the aMT6s peak between individuals on each schedule.

The early diagnosis of sleep apnea is beneficial for the prevention of diseases. Polysomnography (PSG) recording provides comprehensive data for such assessment, but is not suitable for use at home due to discomfort during measurement and the difficulty of identification. This study proposes an unobtrusive measurement process by placing fiber optic sensors (FOSs) in a pillow (head-neck) or a bed mattress (thoracic-dorsal). APPROACH: We test two approaches: drop degrees from the baseline to validate the capability of catching respiratory drops, and linear regression models based on a new global measure, the percentage of the total duration of respiratory declination (PTDRD), to estimate the hand-scored apnea/hypopnea index (AHI). MAIN RESULTS: Based on data recorded from 63 adults, the drop degrees derived from respiratory signals exhibited statistical differences among central sleep apnea (CSA), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and normal breathing. The regression models based on the PTDRDs derived from head-neck FOS and thoracic-dorsal FOS also achieved good agreement with manually scored AHIs in Bland-Altman plots as well as oronasal airflow and thoracic wall movement.

In this paper, we propose a precise heart rate measurement method assisted by machine learning based sleep posture estimation. Machine learning is used for processing time-domain signal of the Doppler radar. Doppler radar has attracted much attention due to its non-contact to the subject feature. Moreover, it will not encroach into the privacy of the subject compared to image sensors. The method proposed in this paper automatically removes the data from the raw signal while the patient is moving or is not staying on the bed. This method based on machine learning uses simple features to reduce the computational cost thereby enabling real-time application.

Here, we assessed some commercially available sleep trackers, namely an activity tracker; Mi band (Xiaomi, Beijing, China), a scientific actigraph: Motionwatch 8 (CamNTech, Cambridge, UK), and a much-used mobile phone application: Sleep Cycle (Northcube, Gothenburg, Sweden). We recorded 27 nights in healthy sleepers using PSG and these devices and compared the results. Surprisingly, all devices had poor agreement with the PSG gold standard. Sleep parameter comparisons revealed that, specifically, the Mi band and the Sleep Cycle application had difficulties in detecting wake periods which negatively affected their total sleep time and sleep-efficiency estimations. However, all 3 devices were good in detecting the most basic parameter, the actual time in bed.

Method(s): In sum, 33,835 submissions (data sample 1) of the expanded and revised BISQ-R by caregivers of infants and toddlers (1-36 months) were analyzed in the US via a publicly-available smartphone application, Johnson's Bedtime. Three subscales were created: Infant Sleep (IS; 5 items), Parent Perception (PP; 3 items), and Parent Behavior (PB; 11 items). The scoring algorithm was based on an age-based normative system, and each subscale was scored using a weighted average of items. Primary application of the scoring model was performed on a follow up set of 16,531 submissions (data sample 2). Secondary application was tested on an original web-based ecology study (data sample 3). Tertiary application was tested using previously published datasets consisting of a longitudinal study (data sample 4) and randomized control trial behavioral intervention study (data sample 5). Result(s): Overall application of the scoring algorithm was confirmed across multiple samples. Each subscale (IS, PP, PB) and total score (T) is age referenced (scores range from 0 to 100). Cross-comparison between subscales across studies reveal consistent and convergent relationships. Conclusion(s): The BISQ-R provides a comprehensive assessment of infant and toddler sleep patterns, as well as parent perception and parent behaviors that may contribute to sleep outcomes.

Achieving accurate prediction of sepsis detection moment based on bedside monitor data in the intensive care unit (ICU). A good clinical outcome is more probable when onset is suspected and treated on time, thus early insight of sepsis onset may save lives and reduce costs. Methodology. We present a novel approach for feature extraction, which focuses on the hypothesis that unstable patients are more prone to develop sepsis during ICU stay. These features are used in machine learning algorithms to provide a prediction of a patient's likelihood to develop sepsis during ICU stay, hours before it is diagnosed. Results. Five machine learning algorithms were implemented using R software packages. The algorithms were trained and tested with a set of 4 features which represent the variability in vital signs. These algorithms aimed to calculate a patient's probability to become septic within the next 4 hours, based on recordings from the last 8 hours. The best area under the curve (AUC) was achieved with Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial basis function, which was 88.38%. Conclusions. The high level of predictive accuracy along with the simplicity and availability of input variables present great potential if applied in ICUs. Variability of a patient's vital signs proves to be a good indicator of one's chance to become septic during ICU stay.Copyright © 2019 Eli Bloch et al.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:25Z,2022-08-24T07:29:25Z,NA,5930379,NA,"(Bloch, Rotem) Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Afeka Academic College of Engineering, Tel Aviv, Israel",2019,NA,J.

Its simplicity and cost-effectiveness has enabled a variety of biomedical applications, such as continuous long-term monitoring of heart arrhythmias, fitness, and sleep tracking, and hydration monitoring. One major issue that can hinder PPG-based applications is movement artifacts, which can lead to false interpretations. In many implementations, noisy PPG signals are discarded. Misinterpreted or discarded PPG signals pose a problem in applications where the goal is to increase the yield of detecting physiological events, such as in the case of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF)-a common episodic heart arrhythmia and a leading risk factor for stroke. In this work, we compared a traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches for PPG quality assessment in the presence of AF, in order to find the most robust method for PPG quality assessment. APPROACH: The training data set was composed of 78278 30s long PPG recordings from 3764 patients using bedside patient monitors. Two different representations of PPG signals were employed-a time-series based (1D) one and an image-based (2D) one. Trained models were tested on an independent set of 2683 30s PPG signals from 13 stroke patients. MAIN RESULTS: ResNet18 showed a higher performance (0.985 accuracy, 0.979 specificity, and 0.988 sensitivity) than SVM and other deep learning approaches. 2D-based models were generally more accurate than 1D-based models.

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences",NA,1758-535X (electronic),10.1093/gerona/glz044,NA,"BACKGROUND: Sleep characteristics related to duration, timing, continuity, and sleepiness are associated with mortality in older adults, but rarely considered in health recommendations. We applied machine learning to: (i) establish the predictive ability of a multidimensional self-reported sleep domain for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in older adults relative to other established risk factors and (ii) to identify which sleep characteristics are most predictive. METHOD(S): The analytic sample includes N = 8,668 older adults (54% female) aged 65-99 years with self-reported sleep characterization and longitudinal follow-up (<=15.5 years), aggregated from three epidemiological cohorts. We used variable importance (VIMP) metrics from a random survival forest to rank the predictive abilities of 47 measures and domains to which they belong. VIMPs > 0 indicate predictive variables/domains. RESULT(S): Multidimensional sleep was a significant predictor of all-cause (VIMP [99.9% confidence interval {CI}] = 0.94 [0.60, 1.29]) and cardiovascular (1.98 [1.31, 2.64]) mortality. For all-cause mortality, it ranked below that of the sociodemographic (3.94 [3.02, 4.87]), physical health (3.79 [3.01, 4.57]), and medication (1.33 [0.94, 1.73]) domains but above that of the health behaviors domain (0.22 [0.06, 0.38]). The domains were ranked similarly for cardiovascular mortality. The most predictive individual sleep characteristics across outcomes were time in bed, hours spent napping, and wake-up time. CONCLUSION(S): Multidimensional sleep is an important predictor of mortality that should be considered among other more routinely used predictors. Future research should develop tools for measuring multidimensional sleep-especially those incorporating time in bed, napping, and timing-and test mechanistic pathways through which these characteristics relate to mortality.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

APPROACH: Overall, 628 women (80+/-6 years old) wore ActiGraph GT3X+accelerometers 24h d-1 for up to 7 d and concurrently completed sleep-logs. Trained staff used a validated visual analysis protocol to measure in-bed periods on accelerometer tracings (criterion). The Tracy and McVeigh algorithms were adapted for optimal use in older adults. A training set of 314 women was used to choose two key thresholds by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity for each algorithm and data (vertical axis, VA, and vector magnitude [VM]) combination. Data from the remaining 314 women were then used to test agreement in waking wear time (i.e. out-of-bed time while wearing the accelerometer) by computing sensitivity, specificity, and kappa comparing the algorithm output with the criterion. Waking wear time-adjusted means of sedentary time, light-intensity physical activity (light PA) and moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) were then estimated and compared. MAIN RESULTS: Waking wear time agreement with the criterion was high for Tracy_VA, Tracy_VM, McVeigh_VA, and highest for McVeigh_VM.

DESIGN: Mixed methods, pre-/posttest design. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Resident (n = 44) and staff (n = 38) participants were recruited from a 120-bed nursing home in the Southeast United States. METHOD(S): Digital data on frequency and position of residents were transmitted wirelessly from sensors worn on each resident's anterior chest to estimate nursing staff compliance with repositioning standard of care before and after visual monitors were activated to cue staff. The validated Nursing Culture Assessment Tool was used to determine changes in nursing culture. Benefits and challenges of implementation were assessed by 2 focus groups composed of 8 and 5 female members of the nursing staff (RN, LPN, CNA), respectively, and led by the three authors. Descriptive statistics were used for all quantitative variables, and inferential statistics were applied to categorical variables (chi test or Fisher exact test) and continuous variables (analyses of variance or equivalent nonparametric tests), respectively, where a 2-sided P value of <.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULT(S): System use significantly (P = .0003) improved compliance with every 2-hour repositioning standards. The nursing culture normative ranking percentage increased from 30.9% to 58.2%; this difference was not statistically significant.

This study designed an unconstrained ballistocardiogram (BCG) detection system using acceleration sensor and developed a heart rate extraction algorithm. BCG is a directional signal which is stronger and less affected by respiratory movements along spine direction than in other directions. In order to measure the BCG signal along spine direction during sleep, a 3-axis acceleration sensor was fixed on the bed to collect the vibration signals caused by heartbeat. An approximate frequency range was firstly assumed by frequency analysis to the BCG signals and segmental filtering was conducted to the original vibration signals within the frequency range. Secondly, to identify the true BCG waveform, the accurate frequency band was obtained by comparison with the theoretical waveform. The J waves were detected by BCG energy waveform and an adaptive threshold method was proposed to extract heart rates by using the information of both amplitude and period. The accuracy and robustness of the BCG detection system proposed and the algorithm developed in this study were confirmed by comparison with electrocardiogram (ECG).

The processing framework must be fundamentally adapted to make full use of this signal. Therefore, we propose a new signal-processing framework that determines the signal quality for short signal segments (2 and 4 seconds) using a multi-class classification model (qua_model) based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). We built another independent deep CNN classifier (pos_model) to classify the sleep position. In the validation, 12 subjects were recruited for a 30-minute experiment, which required the subjects to lie on a bed in different sleeping positions. The short segments, classified as clear (C1 class) by the qua_model, were used to determine sleep positions with the pos_model. In 10-fold cross-validation, the qua_model for signals of 4-second length could recognize the signal of the C1 class at a 0.99 precision and a 0.99 recall; the pos_model could recognize the supine sleep position, the left, and right lateral sleep positions at a 0.99 averaged precision and a 0.99 averaged recall.

Early and accurate identification of hypertension is essential to prevent the condition from deteriorating further. As a kind of complex physiological state, hypertension is hard to characterize accurately. However, most existing hypertension identification methods usually extract features only from limited aspects such as the time-frequency domain or non-linear domain. It is difficult for them to characterize hypertension patterns comprehensively, which results in limited identification performance. Furthermore, existing methods can only determine whether the subjects suffer from hypertension, but they cannot give additional useful information about the patients' condition. For example, their classification results cannot explain why the subjects are hypertensive, which is not conducive to further analyzing the patient's condition. To this end, this paper proposes a novel hypertension identification method by integrating classification and association rule mining. Its core idea is to exploit the association relationship among multi-dimension features to distinguish hypertensive patients from normotensive subjects. In particular, the proposed method can not only identify hypertension accurately, but also generate a set of class association rules (CARs). The CARs are proved to be able to reflect the subject's physiological status.

The importance of timely detection of shock is well known, as early interventions improve mortality, while delays render these same interventions ineffective. However, detection is limited by the monitors, parameters, and vital signs that are traditionally used in the intensive care unit (ICU). Many parameters change minimally during the early stages, and when they finally become abnormal, hypovolemic shock has already occurred. The compensatory reserve (CR) is a parameter that represents a new paradigm for assessing physiologic status, as it comprises the sum total of compensatory mechanisms that maintain adequate perfusion to vital organs during hypovolemia. When these mechanisms are overwhelmed, hemodynamic instability and circulatory collapse will follow. Previous studies involving CR measurements demonstrated their utility in detecting central blood volume loss before hemodynamic parameters and vital signs changed. Measurements of the CR have also been used in clinical studies involving patients with traumatic injuries or bleeding, and the results from these studies have been promising. Moreover, these measurements can be made at the bedside, and they provide a real-time assessment of hemodynamic stability. Given the need for rapid diagnostics when treating critically ill patients, CR measurements would complement parameters that are currently being used. Consequently, the purpose of this article is to introduce a conceptual framework where the CR represents a new approach to monitoring critically ill patients. Within this framework, we present evidence to support the notion that the use of the CR could potentially improve the outcomes of ICU patients by alerting intensivists to impending hypovolemic shock before its onset.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,NA,696-706,NA,9,34,NA,J.

Such challenging responsibilities make caregivers susceptible to poor sleep quality with detrimental effects on their overall health. Hence, monitoring caregivers' sleep quality can provide important CPWD stress assessment. Most current sleep studies are based on polysomnography, which is expensive and potentially disrupts the caregiving routine. To address these issues, we propose a clinical decision support system to predict sleep quality based on trends of physiological signals in the deep sleep stage. This system utilizes four raw physiological signals using a wearable device (E4 wristband): heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, body movement, and skin temperature. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, analyses were conducted on a two-week period of sleep monitored on eight CPWD. The best performance is achieved using the random forest classifier with an accuracy of 75% for sleep quality, and 73% for restfulness, respectively. We found that the most important features to detect these measures are sleep efficiency (ratio of amount of time asleep to the amount of time in bed) and skin temperature. The results from our sleep analysis system demonstrate the capability of using wearable sensors to measure sleep quality and restfulness in CPWD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,NA,276-288,NA,"(Sadeghi, Banerjee) Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Kno.e.sis Research Center, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, United States",110,NA,Comput.

This will affect healthcare systems especially with the current situation of decreased bed capacity and increasing costs. Therefore, accurately predicting LOS would have a positive impact on healthcare metrics. The aim of this study is to develop a machine learning-based model approach for predicting in-hospital LOS for cardiac patients. Design(s): Using electronic medical records, we retrospectively extracted all records of patients' visits that were admitted under adult cardiology service. Admission diagnosis and primary treating physician were reviewed to verify selection criteria. A predictive machine learning-based model approach was applied to incorporate simple baseline health data at admission time to predict LOS. Patients were divided into three groups based on their LOS: short (<3 days), intermediate (3-5 days) and long (>5 days). Information gain algorithm was utilized to select the most relevant attributes. Only attributes with information gain of more than zero were used in model building. Four different machine learning techniques were evaluated and their diagnostic accuracy measures were compared. Setting(s): The dataset of this study included adult patients who were admitted between 2008 and 2016 in King Abdulaziz Cardiac Center (KACC). The center is located in King Abdulaziz Medical City Complex in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Participants (dataset): A total of 16,414 consecutive inpatient visits for 12,769 unique patients (mean age of 58.8 +/- 16 years of which 68.2% were males) between 2008 and 2016 were included. The study cohort had a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension 56%, diabetes 56%, dyslipidemia 52%, obesity 33% and smoking 24%). The most common admitting diagnosis was acute coronary syndrome (36%). Result(s): The variables with highest impact on the prediction of in-hospital LOS were on admission heart rate, on admission systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age and insurance status (eligibility). Using machine learning models; Random Forest (RF) model outperformed among all other models (sensitivity (0.80), accuracy (0.80), and AUROC (0.94)). Conclusion(s): We showed that machine learning methods provide accurate prediction of LOS for cardiac patients. This is can be used in clinical bed management and resources allocation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,NA,140-147,NA,"(Daghistani, Al-Mallah) King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",288,NA,Int.

Our objective was to assess factors that influence the decision to use CPMs. METHOD(S): In this qualitative study, we used group-level assessment, a structured method designed to engage diverse stakeholder groups. We recruited clinicians and other staff who work on a 48-bed hospital medicine unit at a freestanding children's hospital. We developed a list of open-ended prompts used to address CPM use on inpatient units. Demographic data were collected from each participant. We conducted 6 sessions to permit maximum participation among all groups, and themes from all sessions were merged and distilled. RESULT(S): Participants (n 5 78) included nurses (37%), attending physicians (17%), pediatric residents (32%), and unit staff (eg, unit coordinator; 14%). Participants identified several themes. First, there are patient factors (eg, complexity and instability) for which CPMs are useful. Second, participants perceived that alarms have negative effects on families (eg, anxiety and sleep deprivation). Third, CPMs are often used as surrogates for clinical assessments. Fourth, CPM alarms cause anxiety and fatigue for frontline staff. Fifth, the decision to use CPMs should be, but is not often, a team decision. Sixth, and finally, there are issues related to the monitor system's setup that reduces its utility. CONCLUSION(S): Hospital medicine staff identified patient-, staff-, and system-level factors relevant to CPM use for children who were hospitalized. These data will inform the development of system-level interventions to improve CPM use and address high alarm rates.Copyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,NA,423-428,NA,6,9,NA,Hosp.

In dementia, these rhythms are often fragmented - probably due to loss of neuronal function of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (the biological ""master clock"" in the brain) and/or weakness of external zeitgebers. We investigated the effects of a prototype dawn-dusk simulator (DDS) on circadian rest-activity cycles, sleep, mood and well-being in a balanced crossover design during fall and winter in 20 institutionalized patients with dementia (86 +/- 6 y, 17 f). All participants had one baseline week followed by exposure to individually timed DDS over their beds for 7-8 weeks. They spent 8 weeks without DDS as a control. Mood, self-reliant daily activity, social behavior, agitation, and quality of life were assessed by standardized questionnaires and visual analogue scales, regularly rated by trained caregivers. Circadian and sleep characteristics of their rest-activity cycles were analyzed by actimetry over 17 weeks. DDS exposure led to significantly better mood in the morning hours after waking. The effects were most pronounced in the second 4 weeks with DDS, indicating that positive effects emerged gradually. Differences in circadian rest-activity cycles and sleep were mainly age-dependent. We found statistically significant correlations between measures of higher quality of life and better mood, greater alertness and circadian rhythm stability. We conclude that continuous, long-term application of dawn-dusk simulation at the sleep-wake transitions appears to increase external zeitgeber strength in institutionalized patients with dementia. The DDS may provide an effective, non-invasive tool to improve mood and ameliorate patients' quality of life.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,NA,110641,NA,"(Bromundt) Sleep-Wake-Epilepsy-Center, Dept. of Neurology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland",124,NA,Exp.

The purpose of this analysis was to test an alternative approach for establishing activity types and food intake bouts in a relatively unconstrained environment. The accuracy of a wearable system for assessing food intake was compared with that from video observation, and inter-rater reliability of annotation was also evaluated. Forty participants were enrolled. Multiple participants were simultaneously monitored in a 4-bedroom apartment using six cameras for three days each. Participants could leave the apartment overnight and for short periods of time during the day, during which time monitoring did not take place. A wearable system (Automatic Ingestion Monitor, AIM) was used to detect and monitor participants' food intake at a resolution of 30 s using a neural network classifier. Two different food intake detection models were tested, one trained on the data from an earlier study and the other on current study data using leave-one-out cross validation. Three trained human raters annotated the videos for major activities of daily living including eating, drinking, resting, walking, and talking. They further annotated individual bites and chewing bouts for each food intake bout. Results for inter-rater reliability showed that, for activity annotation, the raters achieved an average (+/-standard deviation (STD)) kappa value of 0.74 (+/-0.02) and for food intake annotation the average kappa (Light's kappa) of 0.82 (+/-0.04). Validity results showed that AIM food intake detection matched human video-annotated food intake with a kappa of 0.77 (+/-0.10) and 0.78 (+/-0.12) for activity annotation and for food intake bout annotation, respectively. Results of one-way ANOVA suggest that there are no statistically significant differences among the average eating duration estimated from raters' annotations and AIM predictions (p-value = 0.19). These results suggest that the AIM provides accuracy comparable to video observation and may be used to reliably detect food intake in multi-day observational studies.Copyright © 2019 by the authors.

Postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) are substantial motor impairments of IPD and APD. Clinical evidence implies that patients with APD have larger PIGD impairment than IPD patients. Sensor-based gait analysis as instrumented bedside test revealed more gait deficits in APD compared to IPD. However, the diagnostic value of instrumented bedside tests compared to clinical assessments in differentiating APD from IPD patients have not been evaluated so far. Objective(s): The objectives were (a) to evaluate whether sensor-based gait parameters provide additional information to validated clinical scores in differentiating APD from matched IPD patients, and (b) to investigate if objective, instrumented gait assessments have comparable discriminative power to clinical scores. Method(s): In a previous study we have recorded instrumented gait parameters in patients with APD (Multiple System Atrophy and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy). Here, we compared gait parameters to those of retrospectively pairwise disease duration-, age-, and gender-matched IPD patients in order to address this new research questions. To this aim, the PIGD score was calculated as sum of the MDS-UPDRS-3-items ""gait,"" ""postural stability,"" ""arising from chair,"" and ""posture."" Gait characteristics were evaluated in standardized gait tests using an instrumented, sensor-based gait analysis system. Machine learning algorithms were used to extract spatio-temporal gait parameters. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis was performed in order to detect the discriminative power of the instrumented vs. the clinical bedside tests in differentiating IPD from APD. Result(s): Sensor-based stride length, gait velocity, toe off angle, and parameters representing gait variability significantly differed between IPD and APD groups. ROC analysis revealed a high Area Under the Curve (AUC) for PIGD score (0.919), and UPDRS-3 (0.848). Particularly, the objective parameters stance time variability (0.841), swing time variability (0.834), stride time variability (0.821), and stride length variability (0.804) reached high AUC's as well. Conclusion(s): PIGD symptoms showed high discriminative power in differentiating IPD from APD supporting gait disorders as substantial diagnostic target. Sensor-based gait variability parameters provide metric, objective added value, and serve as complementary outcomes supporting clinical diagnostics and long-term home-monitoring concepts.Copyright © 2019 Gasner, Raccagni, Eskofier, Klucken and Wenning.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,NA,5,NA,JAN,10,NA,Front.

Conventionally, the severity assessment of Cerebellar ataxia (CA) is primarily based on expert clinical opinion and hence likely to be subjective. In order to establish inter-rater concordance with enhanced reliability and effectiveness in the assessment of upper limb function, a novel automated system employing Microsoft Kinect© is considered to capture the motion of the patient's finger for objective assessment. This essentially mimics the commonly used finger tracking task clinically assessed through subjective observation. A clinical trial was conducted involving 42 CA patients and 18 age-matched healthy subjects. The relevant kinematically diagnostic features of CA patients allowed a classification accuracy of 97% using the Bayesian Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). The correlation (severity) between the extracted features and the independent severity scores from expert clinicians were collated to achieve a high correlation (${r} = {0.86}$, ${p}< {0.001}$) with the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). The proposed system can efficiently generate objective information of severity as a result of features that are not necessarily observable during standard bedside clinical testing. Furthermore, the superior performance of the Ballistic (finger chase) test indeed supports the credence of the Ramp test redundancy that exists among the wider clinical community.Copyright © 2001-2011 IEEE.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,2022-08-24T07:29:26Z,NA,1081-1091,NA,5,27,NA,IEEE Trans.

New treatment methods that focus on preventing enuretic episodes by means of a pre-void alerting system could improve outcomes for children with NE in many aspects. No such technology exists currently to monitor the bladder to alarm before bed-wetting. The aim of this study is to carry out the feasibility of building, refining and evaluating a new, safe, comfortable and non-invasive wearable autonomous intelligent electronic device to monitor the bladder using a single-element low-powered low-frequency ultrasound with the help of Machine Learning techniques and to treat NE by warning the patient at the pre-void stage, enhancing quality of life for these children starting from the first use. The sensitivity and specificity values are 0.89 and 0.93 respectively for determining imminent voiding need. The results indicate that customised imminent voiding need based on the expansion of the bladder can be determined by applying a single-element transducer on a bladder in intermittent manner. The acquired results can be improved further with a comfortable non-invasive device by adding several more features to the current features employed in this pilot study.

Image-based approaches could be seen as a natural non-intrusive approach for this purpose; however, video devices require special challenging settings for a clinical environment. We propose to estimate the patient's posture from pressure sensors' data mapped to images. Method(s): We introduce a deep learning method to retrieve human poses from pressure sensors data. In addition, we present a second approach that is based on a hashing content-retrieval approach. Result(s): Our results show good performance with both presented methods even in poses where the subject has minimal contact with the sensors. Moreover, we show that deep learning approaches could be used in this medical application despite the limited amount of available training data. Our ConvNet approach provides an overall posture even when the patient has less contact with the mattress surface. In addition, we show that both methods could be used in real-time patient monitoring. Conclusion(s): We have provided two methods to successfully perform real-time in-bed patient pose estimation, which is robust to different sizes of patient and activities.

This study investigated the feasibility of the E-scale system for detecting and classifying movements in bed which are relevant for pressure injury risk assessment using a threshold-based detection algorithm and a K-nearest neighbor classification approach. The E-scale was able to detect and classify four types of movements (rolls, turns in place, extremity movements and assisted turns) with >94% accuracy.

We hypothesized that a brief, relatively simple daily upper airway exercise regimen, administered by a smartphone application, would reduce snoring and encourage compliance. Method(s): Targeted vowel sounds causing tongue base movements were incorporated into a voice-controlled smartphone game application. Participants with habitual snoring, apnea hypopnea index (AHI) <= 14 events/h, and BMI <= 32 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to perform 15 min of daily gameplay (intervention group) or 5 s of daily voice recording (control group) and to audio record their snoring for 2 nights/week for up to 12 weeks. Sounds above 60 dB were extracted from recordings for snore classification with machine learning support vector machine classifiers. Result(s): Sixteen patients (eight in each group) completed the protocol. Groups were similar at baseline in gender distribution (five males, three females), mean BMI (27.5 +/- 3.8 vs 27.4 +/- 3.8 kg/m2), neck circumference (15.1 +/- 1.6 vs 14.7 +/- 1.7 in.), Epworth Sleepiness Score (8 +/- 3.5 vs 7 +/- 4.0), and AHI (9.2 +/- 4.0 vs 8.2 +/- 3.2 events/h). At 8 weeks, the absolute change in snoring rate (> 60 dB/h) was greater for the intervention group than the control group (- 49.3 +/- 55.3 vs - 6.23 +/- 23.2; p = 0.037), a 22 and 5.6% reduction, respectively.

Although the human pose estimation for various computer vision (CV) applications has been studied extensively in the last few decades, the in-bed pose estimation using camera-based vision methods has been ignored by the CV community because it is assumed to be identical to the general purpose pose estimation problems. However, the in-bed pose estimation has its own specialized aspects and comes with specific challenges, including the notable differences in lighting conditions throughout the day and having pose distribution different from the common human surveillance viewpoint. In this paper, we demonstrate that these challenges significantly reduce the effectiveness of the existing general purpose pose estimation models. In order to address the lighting variation challenge, the infrared selective (IRS) image acquisition technique is proposed to provide uniform quality data under various lighting conditions. In addition, to deal with the unconventional pose perspective, a 2-end histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) rectification method is presented. The deep learning framework proves to be the most effective model in human pose estimation; however, the lack of large public dataset for in-bed poses prevents us from using a large network from scratch. In this paper, we explored the idea of employing a pre-Trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on large public datasets of general human poses and fine-Tuning the model using our own shallow (limited in size and different in perspective and color) in-bed IRS dataset. We developed an IRS imaging system and collected IRS image data from several realistic life-size mannequins in a simulated hospital room environment. A pre-Trained CNN called convolutional pose machine (CPM) was fine-Tuned for in-bed pose estimation by re-Training its specific intermediate layers. Using the HOG rectification method, the pose estimation performance of CPM improved significantly by 26.4% in the probability of correct key-point (PCK) criteria at PCK0.1 compared to the model without such rectification. Even testing with only well aligned in-bed pose images, our fine-Tuned model still surpassed the traditionally tuned CNN by another 16.6% increase in pose estimation accuracy.Copyright © 2013 IEEE.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:27Z,2022-08-24T07:29:27Z,NA,8611350,NA,"(Liu, Yin, Ostadabbas) Augmented Cognition Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, United States",7,NA,IEEE J.

Method(s): We assayed sleep duration over two weeks using actigraphy in a sample of 98 adolescents (ages 14-18, 51 female). Reports of adolescents setting their own bedtime and parental monitoring of bedtime were collected and, using principal components analysis, reduced to one factor representing bedtime autonomy. In a subsample of participants (n = 63) frequency of nighttime cellphone use and reports of cellphone disruption were assessed and combined into a composite score of cellphone usage. Result(s): Increasing age was associated with shorter total sleep duration, r(98) = -.28, p =.006. Age-related sleep duration was mediated by bedtime autonomy, abcs = -.11, 95% BC CI [-.2167, -.0370]. The effects of bedtime autonomy were moderated by nighttime cellphone use such that bedtime autonomy was most problematic for adolescents who used cellphones more frequently, B = -10.44, SE = 4.64, 95% BC CI [-21.3749, -2.8139], compared with those who used cellphones less frequently, B = -1.94, SE = 3.28, 95% BC CI [-9.8694, 3.6205]. Conclusion(s): Adolescence is characterized by insufficient sleep due to biological and environmental factors. Although age is frequently cited as an important element in declining sleep duration, our results suggest age may be a proxy for other co-occurring psychosocial changes during adolescence. These findings identify mechanisms by which parents and adolescents may help increase the amount of sleep adolescents achieve.Copyright © 2018",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:27Z,2022-08-24T07:29:27Z,NA,124-130,NA,1,64,NA,J.

The objective of this study is to validate and compare machine-learning based predictive models for sleep duration of children using Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) question items. Method(s): In 2014, a total of 687 Korean parents/caregivers of children aged 0~36 months completed the internet-based expanded version of BISQ which included specific questions of infants' daytime and nighttime sleep patterns as well as their sleep-related behaviors. We developed models for sleep duration prediction with six machine learning algorithms using BISQ findings. The algorithms used in this study were the following: Random forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, support vector machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, logistic regression, and K-nearest neighbor. The measure used to compare the performance of the proposed methods was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for total sleep duration of Korean infants.

They could benefit to the biomechanics community as testing beds for bio-inspired motor control or prosthetics researches. This paper presents the recent retrofitting work of the ROBIOSS team on the large-sized humanoid robot BIP (15 DOFs, 1.8 m, and 105 kg) (Sardain et al. 1998). This paper aims to show the feasibility and the efficiency of an industrial controller operating a humanoid robot. We propose here a general overview of the platform evolution, its controller and its hardware. Some results are given to illustrate the relevance of this approach. 2. Methods 2.1. Mechanical retrofit An important effort was done to select the appropriate actuators to replace the old 190V DC brushless motors. To facilitate the hardware integration, 80V DC brushless motors were chosen. The method developed to choose the adequate motor was to use reference computed gaits generated for the initial version of the humanoid BIP. The original version being heavier than the new one, the proposed approach is meaningful in terms of actuator sizing. The generated gaits are obtained from the dynamic walking generator given in subsection 3.1. A dynamic model of the robot gives back the motor torques. Several tests were carried out for different gaits (stepping, walking at different speeds with different initial knee flexions, squat and sway motions) and for all the joints. New mechanical brackets were designed to fix the new motors on the existing frame which consist of the yellow anodized parts in Figure 1. New belt/pulleys ratios were computed to adapt the characteristics of the motors to the joints. All the existing sensors (potentiometers on the joints axis and force sensors in the sole) were tested and calibrated. 2.2. Control hardware retrofit The heart of the control hardware (Figure 1) is a B&R X20CP1586 unit PLC (ATOM 1.6 GHz processor with 512MB DDR2 RAM) that communicates over an Ethernet POWERLINK protocol with the drives and I/O cards. The ACOPOSmicro drives provide a small computation unit to support the adjustable low level control loop and a limited number of functions, notably the feed forward controller. This set-up was also selected to be scalable. The fieldbus bandwidth allows us to install easily any number of I/O modules. Moreover, any lack of computation power could be palliated by replacing the X20CP1586 unit with an industrial PC without modifying the control software. 2.3. Software architecture We developed entirely our controller with an Object Oriented Programming approach. We opted for a complete integrated design to avoid any compatibility issue from external libraries and to palliate the lack of specific tools required for humanoid control in the native B&R environment. The embedded controller relies on a new framework for real-time multiaxis and multirobot control called ""RTRobMultiAxisControl"" (Fischer et al. 2019), which facilitates interoperability. The controller consists in a main synchronous core and several specific modules (structural and utilitarian). The core module manages the synchronous behaviour of the robot and its main task runs a set of functions that could be split into a classical acquisition/processing/ action loop. There are three structural modules: Mechanism, Virtual Mechanism and Control. The two mechanism modules contain a full set of objects allowing a complete representation of the machine such as the Forward Kinematic Model or the Inverse Dynamic Model. The Control module manages every high level control law. Five utilitarian modules have been implemented so far: a dedicated mathematical and matrix calculation library supporting the matrix-based Lagrangian formalism, a trajectory generator, a signal processing unit, a parametrical identification module designed to calibrate the sensors and an input/output file manager. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Dynamic motion generator ORHRO dynamic motion generator is based on Kajita et al. (2003) that models the humanoid as an inverted pendulum with a concentrated mass located at the Center Of Gravity (COG), its altitude being constant. Its advantages are to obtain decoupled equations, on the transversal and longitudinal axis, between COG and Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and also to control the ZMP of the whole robot via its COG. The Inverse Kinematics Model of the humanoid robot (15 unknowns) is solved as follow. The multibody COG needs to follow the computed path of the inverted pendulum (3 nonlinear equations). 8 nonlinear equations are used to constrain the posture (6 for the position and the orientation of the free foot and 2 for the orientation of the trunk, the yaw motion being relaxed). The last constraints are the range limits of the 15 joints. The classical method used to solve this redundant problem is to minimize at time step k a criterion J given in Eq. (1) under constraints using Sequential Quadratic Programming. Global parametric optimization will be used in the future to obtain some more human-like motions. 3.2. First experiments The period of the PLC controller is set at 2 ms. The motions (Figure 2) have been generated offline with the dynamic motion generator stated in 3.1. 3.2.1. Squat motion We use here a fifth order polynomial interpolator between starting and ending positions to generate the vertical motion of the COG (range of motion: 15 cm, duration: 5 s). The COG is kept fixed in the transversal plane, the orientation of the trunk is kept vertical. 3.2.2. Sway motion To avoid torque peaks, the reference path of the ZMP, being located within the support polygon, is built as piecewise polynomial functions of time with null speed and acceleration at the beginning and at the end of each phase. The ZMP motion is only transversal (range of motion: 13 cm, transfer duration: 3.75 s). The orientation of the trunk is kept vertical. Figure 2 shows the obtained motions: the constraints are respected (orientation of the trunk). This good behaviour emphasizes the ability of the proposed control architecture to execute complex motions. Fatigue tests were carried on to assess the robustness of OHRHO in terms of control and mechanics. 4. Conclusions This paper presents the evolution from BIP to ORHRO, a humanoid robot with a new control architecture based on a new framework for real-time multiaxis and multirobot control. The preliminary experiments have shown the validity of the proposed approach to achieve dynamic motions.

One such manifestation of this disturbance is the circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Irregular Sleep- Wake Rhythm Disorder (ISWRD). There are currently no treatments approved for ISWRD. The controlled treatment period of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept and dose-finding clinical trial has been completed, which included endpoints related to the effect of lemborexant on nighttime sleep, daytime wakefulness, circadian rhythm parameters, and other clinical measures of ISWRD in patients with mild to moderate AD-D. Method(s): Subjects 60 to 90 years who met criteria for both AD and ISWRD were recruited from sites in the United States, Japan and the UK. Eligible subjects had Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores between 10 and 26 and were not clinically depressed. Patients with moderate to severe sleep apnea were excluded based on polysomnography. Subjects wore actigraphy devices (MotionWatch 8, CamNtech; MW8) continuously on the non-dominant wrist for approximately 14 days, and were eligible for randomization after meeting criteria indicating both disrupted nighttime sleep and daytime wakefulness. Subjects were randomized to placebo or to 1 of 4 treatment arms of lemborexant (2.5, 5, 10, or 15 mg), and provided instructions to take the study medication before the time the subject intended to try to sleep. Efficacy variables were derived from the actigraphy data at screening, baseline, and over 1 month of treatment, and included but were not limited to actigraphy-based sleep and wake efficiency, sleep and wake fragmentation indices, duration of sleep bouts during the day and wake bouts at night, timing and activity within the least 5 active hours, relative amplitude, intradaily variability, and interdaily stability. In addition, scored epochs (30 sec) from each patient were obtained for further analysis. The raw actigraphs from each patient for each data was available and utilized for functional analysis as well. To assist in the analysis of data, informants maintained a log each day of the study to indicate when the subjects went to bed for the night and when they got out of bed in the morning as well as times when the actigraph was not recording data e.g. if the device had been removed for some reason. Following the 4-week treatment period, there was a 2-week follow-up period without study medication to assess for possible rebound ISWRD symptoms (using actigraphy) and for safety. Result(s): Since ISWRD is a relatively new therapeutic area, there is limited knowledge about the utility of numerous efficacy measures obtained from the patients' actigraphy data for evaluating efficacy. To this end, Multivariate Network Analysis of key efficacy variables related to circadian rhythms was conducted to identify the primary variables impacted by treatment, as well as inter-relationships among them. Special methods were used, since the number of variables was large compared to the small sample size of 61 randomized subjects. In particular, machine learning methods were applied to perform variable selection, assuming a sparse multivariate network topology. The algorithm selected a few night-time and day-time efficacy variables for each patient. The selected variables were compared across treatment groups in univariate regression models. In addition, functional data analysis summary measures were obtained using a novel algorithm to process the patients' actigraphy data. Differences between treatment groups using these functional measures were evaluated as well. The key findings were that lemborexant 5 mg showed benefit over placebo between baseline and week 4 of treatment as follows, (a) larger decrease in average duration of sleep bouts during the day; (b) larger decrease in average activity during the least active 5 hours of the day; (c) earlier onset of the least 5 hours of activity of the day (but still during the night); and (d) larger decrease in the average number of wake bouts at night. The actigraph functional analysis showed that lemborexant 5mg was associated with a higher increase in amplitude (1/2 peak to nadir difference) and circadian quotient (ratio of amplitude and mesor (the average activity over the 24-hr period) when compared with placebo from baseline to week 4 of treatment. Conclusion(s): This randomized clinical trial provides important new information regarding the potential utility of this investigational medication to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms that impact the quality of life of ISWRD/AD-D patients and their caregivers and families through the use of novel analytic methodology.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:27Z,2022-08-24T07:29:27Z,NA,S46-S47,NA,Supplement 1,6,NA,J.

Rescue services, fall detection, telemedicine already proved their effectiveness in increasing self-reliance of older adults living alone: Internet of Things (IoT) technology, providing distributed home intelligence at low costs and low in-trusiveness, may open further opportunities. Conventionally, remote clinical parameter monitoring is performed by using specific medical devices; this, however, require schedule compliance and skill and, in the longer perspective, outcomes can be jeopardized by carelessness and boredom. Complementarily, information about meaningful changes in health and wellbeing can be obtained by indirect observation. Many medical conditions, in fact, manifest themselves with behavioral symptoms (e.g., unusual sleeping patterns, or reduced physical activity) which, in turn, can be inferred by tracking home activity, without any action required to the user. This relieves the user from demanding measurement schedules and is suitable for users having no actual skill (e.g., cognitively impaired persons). Inherent challenges come from the need of recognizing relevant features within a continuous flow of unspecific data. User-specific knowledge is needed, which in turn calls for adaptive approaches. Method(s): In the NOAH project (funded in the framework of AAL-JP programme), continuous monitoring is introduced, based on a new generation of IoT daily life activity sensors that detect routines as bed patterns, toilet usage, room presence, and others. Such devices exploit the Wi-Fi communication protocol, connecting directly to the Internet, with no need of home hubs. This makes the approach extremely flexible and simple to deal with, supporting personalization and self-management. A suite of cloud-based analytics tools (ranging from statistical analysis to deep-learning techniques) is available to extract meaningful information, such as behavioral trends (either slow or abrupt) and anomalies. Unsupervised analytics is based on the acquisition of user-specific behavioral profile, so that relative changes are assessed, with respect to learned habits. Multivariate clustering techniques are exploited to work out multi-modal profiles, in which multiple customary activity patterns can be accounted for (e.g., related to the weekday, climate or mood). Deviations from such patterns trigger communication with the end-user or his caregiver, by means of simple smart-phone apps. Key results: The NOAH system is being deployed at several users' homes (up to 60 at the end of recruitment phase), in three European countries (Italy, Romania, Belgium). A co-creation process, involving endusers and stakeholders, has been exploited to devise main system features. A large dataset is being collected, onto which the analytics engine continuously performs trend and anomaly detection. Through periodic evaluation (involving questionnaires), effectiveness of the approach, as perceived by caregivers, will be assessed. Conclusion(s): The NOAH system aims at continuous monitoring of daily living patterns, based on distributed sensing through innovative WiFi-based devices. Cloud-based analysis tools, based on machine-learning techniques, are exploited to sift through raw data, providing caregivers with meaningful health-related insights. The approach is being field-validated to evaluate its impact in fostering better knowledge, and thus better care.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:27Z,2022-08-24T07:29:27Z,NA,S42-S43,NA,Supplement 1,31,NA,Technol.

While guidelines exist for clinical use of actigraphy, this technology has also been adopted in large multicentre trials and longitudinal studies. One barrier to broader use has been the convention of referencing sleep-wake logs (typically in the form of a diary or pre-bed questionnaire) to identify sleep periods. This identification is often required by proprietary actigraphy software. However, this approach adds a subjective dimension to objective actigraphy, increases burden to participants, and may conflict with ecological/naturalistic assessment. We compared sleep log versus no-log approaches to sleep duration estimation in young children to determine the agreement. Material(s) and Method(s): data were from 61 children aged 12-40 months recruited from 19 Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) services in Brisbane, Australia. Actigraphs (GeneActiv original) were worn on the non-dominant wrist of each child for 1-2 weeks. Data were sampled at 50Hz and processed with GGIR (R Language) open source software (Van Hees et al. 2018, version 1.5-24). This software uses an arm-angle criterion for sleep. GGIR provides five options for sleep time definition: 1) rely on sleep log (conventional), 2) use sleep log as a guide, 3) a 12 hour window centred on the least active 5 hours, 4) a heuristic algorithm based on distributional changes of the Z-angle, and 5) a user specified time window e.g., 6pm to 6am. Sensitivity analyses for each method were conducted across four sleep onset criteria and options were compared directly via Bland-Altman difference plots. Result(s): Using the conventional method of relying on the sleep log and 5 minute sleep onset criteria as the baseline, the following bias was observed for the other measures: log as guide (+1.8%), 12 hour window on least 5 active hours (-2.7%), heuristic algorithm (-5.4%) and user specified time window (+2.6%). Sleep onset criteria had large effects on estimated sleep. Using 5 minutes as the baseline the following bias was observed for the conventional method that relies on the sleep log: 10 minutes (-23%), 15 minutes (-37%) and 20 minutes (-47%). Conclusion(s): These data show that estimates of sleep duration generated with methods without reference to a sleep log were comparable to a conventional approach using a sleep log. However, the large variability in sleep depending on sleep onset criteria demonstrate sensitivity analysis should be performed. While a sleep log may provide qualitative information important for some types of studies, analyses of large-scale use of actigraphy may be efficiently conducted with reference to actigraphy data only. The comparability of these methods needs to be demonstrated with other accelerometry technologies and scoring algorithms, and certainly in other groups.

RMD can cause injury, impaired sleep quality and daytime adverse effects. Diagnosis of rhythmic movements during sleep is currently based on visual inspection of 2D video data. We used contactless and automatic 3D video to analyze rhythmic movements and compared it to conventional 2D video expert scoring. We further developed novel indices to quantify RMD severity with the goal to set out the basis for future international standards of assessment. Material(s) and Method(s): One ceiling-mounted camera captured 3D depth images using the time-of-flight of the light while another camera recorded 2D infrared video. Movements of the participant lying in bed cause changes in the 3D depth image allowing for the detection of rhythmic movement episodes using our algorithms. We applied cross-validation and random forest classification to separate general movements from rhythmic ones. According features were obtained from frequency analysis using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with non-overlapping windows of three seconds size. 2D videos were annotated manually by two human scorers to obtain the ground truth. Movement episodes were defined as rhythmic when they contained 3 or more movements performed with a frequency of 0.5 to 2.0 Hz. We recruited 6 children (2 female) with expert somnologist confirmed rhythmic movement disorder between age 5 and 14 y (M: 9.0 y, SD: 4.2 y). Data of two nights in a sleep laboratory was analyzed. We developed new indices to provide a standardized way of extracting additional information of rhythmic movements: The rhythmic movement index (RMI) represents the number of episodes per hour and is based on indices used to characterize other sleep disorders like the periodic limb movement index or apnea/hypopnea index, the duration index (DI) indicating the percentage of time spent in rhythmic movements and the frequency index providing details on how fast rhythmic movements were executed. Result(s): Automatic 3D video analysis and manual 2D annotations demonstrated high levels of agreement, as indicated by a F1-score > 0.9 and a Cohen's Kappa > 0.9. Automatic 3D tended to discriminate rhythmic episodes more sensitive as represented in a higher rhythmic movement index (RMI-3D: 2.6 episodes/hour, RMI-2D: 0.77 episodes/hour) showing that 3D detects more episodes, while simultaneously a similar duration index (DI-3D: 6.04 %, DI-2D: 5.93 %) displays that total episode duration is just slightly different. Newly introduced severity indices demonstrated how rhythmic movement assessment can be improved. Conclusion(s): We introduced automatic detection of rhythmic movements during sleep using a contactless 3D sensor. Body sizes and movement semiologies were diverse, regardless of this, the agreement of expert annotated 2D and automated 3D videos was high. Automatic 3D analysis provided reliable quantitative information about rhythmic movements, reducing the burden of time expensive manual scoring. Furthermore, the proposed novel indices offer a means to standardize measurement of rhythmic movement disorders in both clinical and research practice, which allows us to better compare literature on this topic in the future.Copyright © 2019",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:27Z,2022-08-24T07:29:27Z,NA,S122-S123,NA,Supplement 1,64,NA,Sleep Med.,NA,15th World Sleep Congress.

The weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) and the weighted Symbolic Mutual Information (wSMI) have been specifically designed to minimise the impact of EEG volume conduction confounds. We recently demonstrated that they present a different sensitivity to linear and non-linear interaction dynamics. Here we investigated whether these two methods may unveil distinct functional differences across four stages of vigilance (wakefulness, NREM (N2/N3), REM sleep). Method(s): Twenty-four healthy participants (27+/-6yrs, 13F) underwent hd-EEG recordings (257 channels, 500Hz) during the night (11.30PM-7AM) and while awake in bed after sleep (8AM; 6min, eyes-closed). All recordings were pre-processed using standard procedures. Given that different amounts of data were available for each subject and sleep stage, a bootstrapping procedure (with replacement) was performed to obtain comparable numbers of data-segments across wakefulness (W), N2, N3 and REM-sleep. Specifically, for all conditions we extracted at each iteration (N=1000) 15 random 2s epochs. For each iteration, we computed the median power spectral density (PSD) across electrodes and the median connectivity (wPLI/wSMI) across all pairs of channels in delta, theta, alpha, sigma, beta, and gamma frequency bands. The subjects were divided into two equal-sized groups. A two-fold (i.e. training on group-1(2) and testing on group-2(1)) linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was applied to investigate the ability of power- and connectivity-based features obtained from one group to discriminate vigilance stages in the other group. The best features for each classifier were identified using a generalised ranking across forward- and backward-selection. Permutation tests (N=1000, shuffling of labels in training dataset) were performed to test for statistical significance. Result(s): The maximum classification accuracy obtained with each single metric was 56.0% for PSD, 61.4% for wPLI and 63.8% for wSMI. The combination of two metrics increased accuracy to 71.1% for PSD+wPLI, 69.3% for PSD+wSMI, and 74.2% for wPLI+wSMI. The highest accuracy (78.3%) was obtained for the joint PSD+wPLI+wSMI classifier, for which the best features included alpha-wSMI, sigma-wPLI, and delta-wPLI. Follow-up statistical comparisons (paired non-parametric permutation tests; p < 0.05, Bonferroni correction) showed that both NREM (N2/N3) and REM-sleep were characterised by increased delta-wPLI (N2>N3>REM>W) and decreased alpha-wSMI (W>N3>N2>REM) with respect to W. For the classification of W vs. REM, alpha-wSMI alone achieved 87% accuracy. Sigma connectivity (wPLI/wSMI) was higher in N2/N3-sleep with respect to both W and REM-sleep (no differences between W and REM). Discussion(s): The combined use of wPLI and wSMI connectivity metrics better describes changes in brain activity across vigilance stages compared to either individual connectivity approaches or power-based indices alone. The differences between sleep and wakefulness in delta- and alpha-connectivity are in line with previous observations in states of altered levels of consciousness, including in patients with disorders of consciousness and in anaesthesia. However, connectivity in these bands was also significantly different between wakefulness and REM-sleep, a stage typically characterised by vivid conscious experiences (dreams). In this light, these connectivity changes could mark disconnection/disengagement from the external environment rather than the current level of consciousness.Copyright © 2019",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:27Z,2022-08-24T07:29:27Z,NA,S167,NA,Supplement 1,64,NA,Sleep Med.,NA,15th World Sleep Congress.

Previously, we have developed a non-contact computer vision technique to track respiratory motion and estimate respiratory rate (Li et al. 2017, in IEEE J Biomed Health Inform). Performance of this algorithm was validated in a dark room in awake subjects who simulated sleeping condition by staying still, as other body movements unrelated to respiration would introduce significant noise. Those with sleep apnea experience multiple arousals during sleep and move more during sleep. Therefore, we improved the algorithm such that unrelated body movements were automatically identified. We further validated the proposed method for motion based respiratory rate estimation during unconstrained nocturnal sleep in those who are suspected of having sleep apnea. Material(s) and Method(s): Adults between the ages of 18 to 85, who were referred for clinical overnight polysomnography (PSG) were recruited. A near-infrared camera mounted 1.5 m directly above the bed captured movement of head, torso, and arms, at resolution of 640x480 and 30 frames per second. Gold standard respiratory rate was derived from respiratory inductance plethysmography of chest and abdomen. Respiratory rate estimation was obtained by tracking displacements of selected feature points over moving window of 30 seconds with 29 seconds overlap, and applying signal processing techniques as described by Li et al. (2017, in IEEE J Biomed Health Inform). When a large spike in displacement of the tracked feature points was detected, new reference set of feature points was applied. The 30 seconds windows including and following a large motion were labelled as 'movement' and excluded from error analysis. Kruskal-Wallis statistical test was performed with multiple comparison tests to determine whether average root mean square error (RMSE) of respiratory rate estimation was different between various sleep positions or sleep stages. Result(s): Fifty participants (53.0 +/- 14.9 years) were included:12 had no sleep apnea, 13 had mild, 11 had moderate, and 14 had severe sleep apnea. 6.28 +/- 1.17 hours (mean +/- SD) of video were captured for each participant, 0.81 +/- 0.65 hours were identified as movement and 4.60 +/- 1.51 hours of sleep. Compared to the gold standard, 89.9 % +/- 10.9 % of the overnight respiratory rate estimation for each participant was accurate within 1 breath per minute, with an average RMSE of 2.10 +/- 1.64 breaths per minute. No significant difference in estimation of RMSE was found according to various body position, sleep stage, or amount of the body covered by blankets. Respiratory rate estimation was less accurate during apneas/hypopneas compared to periods of normal breathing during sleep (p < 0.0001). For periods including and void of apneas/hypopneas, 83.04% +/- 13.46 % and 94.20 % +/- 8.88% of the estimated respiratory rate were accurate within 1 breath per minute, respectively. Conclusion(s): The vision-based algorithms can be used for accurate, non-contact monitoring of respiratory rate in patients with sleep apnea during sleep.

Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs), for instance, mostly occurs in the lower extremities and usually involves dorsiflexion of the ankle. Evaluation of sleep disorders is typically done through clinical polysomnography (PSG), occasionally accompanied by night-time video recordings. While PSG remains the most reliable and comprehensive tool for such assessments, the studies are intensive in terms of time, cost and labor. Certain motor indices might be underestimated due to the nature of PSG instrumentation, and for many individuals, these studies could be considered intrusive and uncomfortable. In this work, SleepSmart, a mattress-based sensing system composing of an 8x6 array of 3-D accelerometer sensors, was developed to provide time-series data for machine learning algorithms to classify simulated, in-bed movement activities. Material(s) and Method(s): A study with 11 subjects was conducted. Subjects were asked to perform a predefined movement protocol on the SleepSmart mattress for 15 sets. Each movement set consists of 22 unique in-bed movements that were selected to simulate PLMs and movements that are common during sleep. Four learning algorithms were tested and compared. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive- Bayes (NB), and the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithms were used. The movements were classified into 8 classes: head, torso and limbs, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg, both legs, both feet. Result(s): The classification accuracy averaged across all subjects were 98.00%, 95.58%, 92.07%, and 85.77% for subject-dependent models, and 92.02%, 90.66%, 77.51%, and 72.18% for subject-independent models for the RF, SVM, NB and k-NN algorithms, respectively. In RF models, averaged recall and precision measures were 96.93% and 97.76% for subject-dependent models, and 90.18% and 91.56% for subject-independent models. Conclusion(s): In this work, we have proposed a non-invasive sensor system and demonstrated the effectiveness of the mattress sensors in classifying in-bed movements using machine learning algorithms, while considering subject-dependent and subject-independent data sets. RF models showed the best classification performance, followed by SVM, NB, and k-NN models. Further studies need to be conducted to investigate the effect on classifier performances in different patient groups.

The beneficial effect of sleep on memory appears to weaken with increasing age. Changes in sleep micro-architecture that occur in older adults such as reduced SWA and spindles may underlie impaired sleep-dependent memory consolidation (SDMC). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a prevalent sleep disorder in older age, is also associated with changes in sleep micro-architecture. This pilot study examined quantitative sleep EEG correlates of declarative SDMC in older adults with OSA and controls. Material(s) and Method(s): Participants with OSA (n=21, 13 male, age 56+/-16, apnea hypopnea index, AHI 69+/-53) and age-matched healthy controls (n=23, 10 male, age 61+/-17, AHI 8+/-6.8) underwent in-lab overnight polysomnography. They completed a 32 word-pair task administered 1-2 hours before bed. Overnight consolidation was assessed 1 hour after waking following an 8 hour sleep opportunity. Power spectral analysis was performed on all-night EEG recorded at F3-M2 and C4-M1 electrode sites. We calculated slow wave activity (slow oscillations (SO) absolute power 0.25-1 Hz; and delta EEG power (0.5-4.5 Hz) in NREM sleep at the frontal region. Spindle density (11-16 Hz, events p/min, at central and frontal regions) in stage N2 was derived using an automated spindle detection algorithm. Between group differences in spindles, SWA and memory scores were examined. Correlations between EEG measures and overnight recall were assessed. Data are mean +/-SD, SWA measures were log transformed for statistical analyses. Result(s): There were no significant between-group differences in spindle density (OSA: 0.95 +/- 0.73/h vs Controls 0.93 +/-0.48/h, p=0.91), SWA (SO: 255.8 +/- 307.4 muV2vs 375.8 +/- 398.9 muV2,p=0.35; delta power: 322.5 +/-180.2 muV2 vs 393.9 +/-257.5 muV2, p=0.39) or overnight recall (94.6 +/-15.2 % vs 94.7 +/-14.6 %, p=0.98). Within the entire sample (n=43), a greater memory recall was correlated to a higher spindle density at frontal (r=0.26, p=0.035) but not central regions (r=0.12, p=0.29). SWA in NREM was positively associated with recall (SO: r=0.49, p=0.005; delta: r=0.56,p=0.001). In sub-group analyses, SWA was significantly related to recall in both the OSA group (delta: r=0.51, p=0.046) and the control group (SO: r=0.74, p=0.002; delta: r=0.62, p=0.013). AHI was not significantly associated with memory recall in the OSA group (p>0.05). Conclusion(s): Despite the sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia associated with OSA, sleep spindles and slow frequency brain activity in NREM sleep were similar to controls and associated with overnight declarative memory consolidation in both groups. Targeted interventions to boost spindles and slow wave activity may enhance memory consolidation in older adults, even those with OSA.

Body direction does not change during sleeping, and sleeping is sensitive and affected by environmental factors. Aim(s): This neuroarchitecture study aimed to assess the effects of bed orientation on sleep quality to enhance bedroom design. Material(s) and Method(s): To do so, the effects of earth's electromagnetic field (EMF) on sleep electroencephalography (EEG) signals were evaluated using signal processing techniques. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 21 healthy volunteer participants slept for two consecutive naps, at two rooms with identical interior design and different bed orientations, toward and against earth's EMF in a sleep clinic. Statistical Analysis: In this experiment, discrete wavelet transform extracted five subfrequencies of EEG data as delta, theta, alpha, beta1, and beta2. In addition, the energy signals were computed by measurement of wave frequencies. The mean total sleep time was 1.63 h in North-South (N-S) earth's EMF orientation and 1.38 h in the other direction. Result(s): t-test results showed significant changes in delta, theta, and alpha frequencies in terms of bed orientation. There was a significant result in the alpha energy ratio over the whole signal energy. Furthermore, there were increases in the average energy of delta, theta, and alpha bands in N-S versus East-West (E-W) bed directions. Conclusion(s): This study indicated that sleep in N-S direction could be more beneficial than E-W and the sleep EEG signals can be sensitive to earth's EMF. The results show the importance of considering orientation in bedroom design and its benefits on inhabitants' well-being.Copyright © 2019",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,NA,S330-S331,NA,Supplement 1,64,NA,Sleep Med.,NA,15th World Sleep Congress.

We explored sleep EEG profiles of insomnia patients to develop neurophysiological subtypes. Material(s) and Method(s): Participants with Insomnia Disorder completed two consecutive overnight polysomnographic studies (PSG) with total bedtime (TBT) reduced by two hours on the second night. SWA (EEG delta power, 0.5 - 4.5 Hz) across all sleep stages on Night 1 and Night 2 PSGs was computed using absolute power spectral analysis and an interhemispheric asymmetry index ((left SWA - right SWA)/(left SWA + right SWA)) was calculated. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering of 34 objective sleep parameters from Night 1, including SWA in left and right hemispheres, asymmetry index and sleep architecture were measured to determine EEG-based subtypes (ACTRN 12615000751572). Result(s): EEG data from 99 insomnia patients (46.2 (SD 14.9) y; 69.7% female; insomnia severity index 19.9 (SD 4.0) were evaluated. Cluster analysis revealed three objective EEG subtypes of insomnia based on the top 10 independent components derived from Night 1 (88% variance explained). On Night 1, subtype A (n=26) had low global SWA, poor sleep efficiency (62%), the shortest TST (299.2 min), longest WASO duration (132.5 min), and the highest arousal index in NREM compared to other subtypes (all p< 0.001). Subtype B (n=51) also had low SWA across all sleep stages but good sleep efficiency (80.3 %). Subtype C (n=22) showed higher SWA compared to other two subtypes (p< 0.001) and good sleep efficiency (80.0%). Subtype B showed the worst subjective sleep quality and underestimated sleep based on sleep-state misperception index (objective TST-subjective TST/objective TST; p< 0.05). There were no differences in interhemispheric asymmetry between the subtypes; however, subtype B showed a positive correlation between WASO and asymmetry index during REM (p< 0.05). Sleep restriction (-2h TBT) on Night 2 improved all sleep metrics across all subtypes. There was no change in sleep-state misperception between nights across all subtypes, whilst only subtype B showed improvement in subjective sleep quality on Night 2 (p< 0.05). Conclusion(s): We found evidence of three insomnia subtypes based on SWA and PSG sleep parameter differences. While all subtypes reported similar insomnia symptom severity, there were differences in SWA which may explain sleep-state misperception. Subtypes A and B had low SWA and underestimated total sleep duration, despite differences in sleep quality. Whilst sleep restriction improved objective sleep metrics (sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, WASO) there was no change in sleep misperception in subtypes A and B. Whereas subtype C reported insomnia symptom severity similar to the other types, they had high SWA and good sleep quality. These findings indicate that sleep misperception in insomnia may result from different neural mechanisms and that hyperarousal may be influenced by lower SWA and explain subjective sleep complaints.

We developed a machine learning approach to stratify between vital sign (VS) abnormality indicating only mild cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in need of awareness and nursing intervention (MinCRI) and more severe CRI (SevCRI) requiring the nurse to escalate care to a medical provider, and assessed the resulting models discriminatory ability. Method(s): From 326 stepdown unit (SDU) patients, continuous noninvasive VS monitoring data (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, SpO2) were accrued, and time plots of all events of VS excursion beyond local normality threshold (CRI) reviewed by clinicians. After excluding artifacts, the time-plots for 1092 real events were reviewed by four experts (two RNs, 2 MDs) who independently labeled them as MinCRI (in need of nurses awareness, encounter or intervention) of SevCRI (in need of routine escalation to a provider or urgent escalation to a Medical Emergency Team). Only events where at least 3 of 4 experts agreed on the assignment were used as ground truth, leaving 934 (730 Min-CRI and 204 SevCRI) for model building. We fit a random forest model to the data using statistical features extracted during event periods and evaluated it via cross-validation. We also tested the model on a sample of 85 real events from an independent cohort; comparing the model-estimated CRI severity levels with ground truth provided by the experts. Result(s): The overall inter rater agreement among four annotators for the severity labels was 0.33 (Fleiss' Kappa), and the median of pairwise Cohen's kappa was 0.41. The AUC (area under ROC curve) score from the leave-one-patient out cross validation of the resulting model was 0.96. When validating the model on the sample of real alerts from an independent data set, the mean score for SevCRI alerts was 0.81+/-0.12 comparing with .17+/-0.28 for MinCRI alerts, showing significant differentiation. Conclusion(s): A model trained from clinical expert ground truth can discern VS instability severity that only requires nurse attention from events needing escalation of care. If used in realtime monitoring, such a model could inform accurate decisions regarding timely care escalation, thereby improving patient.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,NA,NA,NA,1 Supplement 1,47,NA,Crit.

Early detection and access to the history of a fall is crucial for efficient post-fall care. Real-time video detection and capture of falls thanks to artificial intelligence and secure transmission (SafelyYou technology; published in JMIR 2017, presented at AAIC 2018) offers high potential to support conventional care management in fallers. The objective of the study was to assess whether introduction of SafelyYou technology in memory care facilities would modify post-fall patterns of care provided to individuals with dementia. Method(s): An observational study (November 2017-August 2018) was carried out in six memory care facilities (California). Falls were video-captured (24/24, 7/7) thanks to wall-mounted cameras deployed in 66 out of 199 (33.2%) private bedrooms of consenting residents and families. Falls were video captured and provided to memory care facilities during a 10-months period; real-time detection and notification of falls was provided to facility staff thanks to a customized web-based application after a period of six months. Post-fall outcomes included automated measures of time until assistance (TUA) and of time spent on the ground (TOG). Result(s): A total of 436 falls were captured in 66 fallers (mean age 87y; min=65-max=104), including 12/66 single and 54/66 (82%) multifallers, resulting in an average of 6.6 falls per patient over ten months (SD=8.6; min=1-max=49). No difference in number of falls was found according to gender. Grading of falls' severity showed: 51.1% minor; 34.2% behavioral slipping with no impact-no recovery position; 8.1% moderate-severe; 6.6% near fall with independent recovery. Falls in private spaces (bedrooms) were predominant (82.3% including all moderate-severe falls) and happen at night (maximal time slot 4-8am) and in the evening (8-12pm). Post-fall TUA dropped (p=0.004) from a mean 35.3 minutes (SD=48.3) during the 2-months baseline to a mean 12.6 minutes (34.2). A parallel reduction was observed (p=0.003) with TOG dropping from a mean 43.2minutes (SD=48) at baseline to a mean 19.1minutes (34.2). Conclusion(s): The present study highlights the potential of real-time detection and video review of falls to lower post-fall morbidity and complement existing conventional care in memory care facilities.Copyright © 2019",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,NA,P457,NA,7 Supplement,15,NA,Alzheimer's Dementia,NA,Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2019.

Nocturia results from an imbalance between bladder storage capacity and urine production. Both inadequate bladder storage capacity that results in small voided volumes and increased urinary output during a 24h period or only overnight (nocturnal polyuria) can be due to various underlying reasons. The International Continence Society (ICS) issued in 2002 a defnition of nocturnal polyuria (NP). This was later criticized together with other defnitions due to lack of accuracy in identifying nocturnal polyuria 1. Therefore, nocturia remains challenging to manage due to ambiguous defnitions of NP and reduced functional bladder capacity (FBC) as well as complexed etiology of this condition. We hypothesized that statistical multivariate modeling may be important and therefore we aimed to determine whether models based on direct factors and indirect factors could accurately predict nocturia in a multivariate analysis. STUDY DESIGN, MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current post-hoc analysis was based on screening data from three prospective phase 3, randomized controlled trials (000085, CS40, CS41) conducted to test the efcacy/safety of desmopressin in 2, 575 patients recruited from community and academic practices in Europe and North America. The main inclusion criteria for the screening phase was a complaint of nocturia. Data collection was based on 24 hours frequency volume charts (FVC), collected over three days. Of the 2575 screened patients, we excluded patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, urological malignancies, uncontrolled hypertension, sleep apnoe, poly-dipsia, or incontinence (n=391). We also excluded patients with missing FVC (n=670) and fnally patients of certain races (n=35) as there were no non-nocturic patients of same race for comparison. Of 1479 included patients, 215 patients were non-nocturic and 1248 were nocturic defined as more than 2 voids per night. Patients had a median age of 59 years (IQR:48-68) with 65% being females. The median number of nocturnal voids was 2.7 (IQR:2.0-3.3) Factors proposed to infuence nocturia were divided into two categories: Direct factors: FBC, estimated as the maximum voided volume global polyuria, estimated as total daily voided volume sleep duration in hours nocturnal polyuria (NP), with defnitions tested as either continuous or binary thresholds combined with previously proposed defnitions of NP:-NUPh: ratio of nocturnal voided volume (including frst morning void) by night duration, (NUPh > 54 mL/h, NUPh > 78 mL/h and NUPh > 90 mL/h);-NUPw: ratio of nocturnal voided volume (including frst morning void) by body weight, (NUPw > 10 mL/kg);-NPI: ratio of nocturnal voided volume by 24h total voided volume (Age > 65 AND NPI> 0.33) OR (Age > 20 AND NPI > 0.2);-NI: ratio of nocturnal voided volume by bladder functional capacity (i.e. max voided volume), (NI > 1.5 or NI > 1)-NPIh: ratio of NUPh by DUPh liquid intake within 1 hour before going to bed liquid intake during night Indirect factors: Age Sex Race BMI We tested: Univariate association of each factor with nocturia corrected for multiple testing Strength of correlation between diferent factors and number of voids corrected for multiple testing Discriminatory accuracy of diferent factors in a multivar-iate combination. We tested both continuous and binary defnitions of nocturnal polyuria and additional factors as described above. A combinations of signatures were tested: * 13 with direct factors only:-1 signature for each defnition of NP (both as a continuum and binary factor) + 4 other direct factors,-1 signature with only the 4 direct factors (and no defnition of NP); * 13 with direct and indirect factors. RESULT(S): In univariate analysis, many direct factors such as FBC, sleep duration, all proposed defnitions of nocturnal poly-uria, and two indirect factors (sex and race), discriminated signifcantly nocturic from non-nocturic patients. However, two direct factors (polyuria and nightly liquid intake) were nonsignifcant. All direct factors that contain nocturnal voided volume correlate signifcantly, but only 8 comparisons had moderate to strong Spearman's correlation. Nocturnal polyuria defnitions had moderate to strong correlations to FBC and to total voided volume over 24 hours. The nocturnal polyu-ria defnitions were only weakly correlated unless they were variations of the same theme as nightly urine production per hour or weight (NUPh vs NUPw). The discrimination of each model is reported Figure 1 with models based on NI working best, followed by NUP-in-dices, and NPI-indices. Models without any defnition of NP discriminated poorly. Models with direct factors using NI as NP defnition discriminated well (AUC: 82%-84% by random forest and logistic regression). Models with direct factors using NUPh as NP defnition also provided good discrimination (AUC: 77%-80%). All binary defnitions of NP had lower discriminatory accuracy than the corresponding continuous indices. However, NI > 1.5 had the third best discrimination, after NI and NUPh, with an AUC of 79%. INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS: Recognising that mmanagement of nocturia patients are challenging and there is little evidence in reference to the effect of all possible combinations of treatment modalities. The multivariate analysis ofered insight in what factors that played a major role. In the multivariate model the indirect factors did not contribute to increasing the predictability, which simplifed the model and potentially the diagnosing in terms of information to be collected. The direct factors without a NP defnition alone performed worse than when NP defnition was included. So the best predictive model includes direct factors including a NP defnition. A binary approach to diagnosing nocturnal polyuria may not be optimal if it is recognized that the nocturia is a symptom where several factors contribute. This hypothesis was confirmed by the model. The current binary used defnitions of NP were performing worse than the defnitions used as a continuum in predicting nocturia. While best predictive models were using NI as defnition of N P, this index also captures patients whose nocturia was due to small bladder capacity. Therefore, it was not ideal to describe nocturia caused by an excess of urine production. Instead we suggested to use NUPh which provides almost as good predictive models. CONCLUDING MESSAGE: Univariate analyses showed that all NP defnitions (continuous and binary) show signifcant association to nocturic and non nocturic patients. Sleep duration, bladder capacity, sex and race also show signifcant association. The correlation analysis showed that the most important correlations appear to be among direct factors of nocturia. Yet, the diferent defnitions of NP only show weak to moderate correlations with each other indicating lack of consistency. The multivariate analyses showed that the most useful def-nitions of NP are NI and NUPh. The previously proposed binary NP defnitions showed lower predictive performances than when using the continuous indices. These analyses also showed that NI is not a pure defnition of NP as it also captures nocturia due to small bladder size. In contrast, NUPh seem to be a good defnition of NP alone, leading to good predictive performances when combined to bladder size. Therefore, we recommend using continuous NUPh as a def-nition of N P.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,NA,S64-S66,NA,Supplement 3,38,NA,Neurourol.

A major challenge though lies in how behaviours can be recorded continuously and reliably, as compared with human observations. Our group have recently developed methods that quantify and distinguish behaviour types using standard wearable inertial sensors, in conjunction with high-order movement signature analysis. Here we tested the feasibility and validity of the approach in acute stroke, across a broad range of activity types. Method(s): Patients were recruited who had capacity, and could ambulate. Following consent, patients wore 4 inertial-movement-unit watches on their four limbs, with 100 Hertz real-time data-streaming. Subjects were asked to carry out a series of postural changes during a 30 minute test period, including: lying, sitting up in bed, sitting on chair or bed edge, standing, and walking. Activity timings and type were confirmed by video analysis. Models of activity class were built using quadratic discriminant classifiers and neural nets. Leave 1-out validation tests were performed for each subject in turn. Result(s): Twenty patients completed testing (median age in years: 70 (range: 30-91); median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale: 3.5 (range: 0-8). Data collection occurred with a zero failure rate, and all patients found the sensor system unintrusive or minimally intrusive. Battery life was 6 hours.

In general, diagnosis and evaluation of stenosis are performed by directly observing the lumen shape of a blood vessel by X-ray coronary angiography. However, in the coronary angiography, it is difficult to evaluate the dysfunction of the heart caused by the stenotic lesion. Cardiac nuclear medicine inspection is often performed in myocardial ischemia diagnosis. On the other hand, these diagnosis methods are burdens to patients. In this study, we visualized myocardial blood flow distribution including three-dimensional perfusion area by image reconstruction of coronary angiogram. In the coronary angiography examination, since the X-ray images are acquired from a small number of specific directions, image quality deterioration of the reconstructed image occurs [1]. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluated the feasibility of the proposed method. Methods First, geometry calibration was performed in the C-arm X-ray imaging device used for image acquisition. Here, the coordinates and the direction of the biaxial rotation axis in the arm were acquired. In the image reconstruction, a frame was selected that corresponded to maximally diastolic and sufficiently diffusion of the contrast agent to the myocardium based on electrocardiogram. Three-dimensional perfusion distribution image was acquired by performing image reconstruction from projection images acquired from several directions. Geometry calibration Calibration was carried out using a calibration object in which metal balls with a dimeter of 2 mm were arranged so as not to overlap in the X-ray image. The calibration object was placed on the bed and X-ray imaging was performed with axial rotation at the LAO-RAO angle (primary angle) and sagittal rotation at the CRA-CAU angle (secondary angle). The coordinates and angles of each rotation axis were calculated from the coordinate values of the metal balls on each image. First, the position and attitude of the calibration object from the X-ray source were calculated based on the projection coordinates of the metal ball. A translation and rotation parameter were obtained from the projection coordinates and virtual projection coordinates of the metal ball acquired in each projection direction by the least square method. Next, the intersection point of the three-dimensional straight lines that connected the X-ray source and the detector in the plural directions was calculated as the coordinate of the rotation axis. Finally, based on the three-dimensional arrangement of the X-ray source and detector, the vertical component relative to the rotational movement was acquired by the principal component analysis as the angle of the rotation axis. Image reconstruction A digital subtraction angiography image was used to obtain only the myocardial perfusion distribution image. We used an iterative image reconstruction method using the L1 norm because the number of images was limited, and the myocardial perfusion distribution was distributed in sparse in the acquired three-dimensional image [2]. Results Image reconstruction of a perfusion distribution image was performed on one clinical coronary angiography data. INFX-8000 V (Canon Inc.) was used as X-ray imaging device. In the coronary angiography examination, four imaging directions (RAO = 30 deg CRA = 30 deg, RAO = 30 deg CAU = 30 deg, CRA = 30 deg, CAU = 30 deg) were selected as the imaging direction. A perfusion distribution image was generated for the angiographic image of the left coronary artery. Figure 1 shows the reconstructed three-dimensional perfusion distribution image displayed by the oblique tomographic method. From the results, it was possible to confirm the tomogram of the shape along the myocardial distribution near the approximate left coronary artery. However, we confirmed many missing parts along myocardium in each tomographic image. It is considered that the heartbeat of the images used for image reconstruction and the phases of respiration did not perfectly coincide. In addition, influence due to the nonuniformity of the contrast agent in each projection direction was not considered. Therefore, it is necessary to inject the contrast agent in synchronization with the heartbeat at the time of acquiring the X-ray image in each projection direction. Conclusion We evaluated the feasibility of three-dimensional reconstruction of myocardial blood flow distribution. From experimental results, a perfusion distribution image along the myocardium shape could be generated. As a future work, we will conduct accuracy assessment for comparison with nuclear medicine examinations.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,NA,S3,NA,Supplement 1,14,NA,Int. J. Comput.

Examining the predictive ability of sleep as a multidimensional construct-rather than a series of separate characteristics-may clarify its importance and influence recommendations for measuring public health. We applied machine learning to: (1) establish the predictive ability of multidimensional self-reported sleep for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality relative to other established risk factors; and (2) identify which sleep characteristics are most predictive. Method(s): The analytic sample includes N=8,668 older adults (54% female) aged 65-99 with self-reported sleep characterization and longitudinal follow-up (<=15.5 years), aggregated from three epidemiological cohorts. We used variable Importance (VIMP) metrics from random survival forests to rank the predictive abilities of five domains and the individual measures they comprise. VIMPs > 0 indicate predictive variables/domains. Result(s): The predictive ability of the multidimensional sleep domain for all-cause mortality [VIMP (99.9% CI) = 0.94 (0.60, 1.29); 15 predictors] ranked below that of sociodemographic factors [3.94 (3.02, 4.87); 6 predictors], physical health [3.79 (3.01, 4.57); 10 predictors], and medications [1.33 (0.94, 1.73); 10 predictors] but above that of health behaviors [0.22 (0.06, 0.38); 4 predictors]. For cardiovascular mortality, multidimensional sleep was also a significant predictor [1.98 (1.31, 2.64)] and was ranked similarly among the domains. The most predictive individual sleep characteristics across outcomes were time in bed, napping, and wake-up time. Cohort-specific analyses including additional non-sleep measures that could not be harmonized across cohorts indicated our findings are robust.

Although not as extreme as shift workers, adolescents often have delayed sleep timing. Our aim was to assess whether sleep midpoints in adolescents are associated with DNA methylation of circadian genes. A secondary aim was to examine associations between dietary patterns and circadian gene methylation. Method(s): The study population included 142 Mexican youth (average age 14.0 (SD=2.0) years, 49% male) enrolled in a cohort study. Average sleep midpoint (between bed time and wake time) over 7 days was estimated with actigraphy. Diet was assessed with a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and three dietary patterns were derived from principal components analysis (a vegetable- based pattern, a meat and starch-based pattern, and a breakfast pattern). DNA methylation was quantified in blood leukocytes with the Infinium MethylatinEPIC BeadChip. We selected 166 loci (CpG sites) within CpG islands of core 'clock' genes known to regulate circadian rhythms (CLOCK, BMAL, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1, CRYI2, RORA, RORB, REV-VERBA, REV-VERBB). Linear regression was used to analyze associations between sleep midpoint or dietary patterns and logit-transformed percent methylation at the 166 CpG sites. All models were adjusted for sex and age. Result(s): The average midpoint was 3:41 AM (SD=1 hr 15 min); average bed time was 11:29 PM (SD=68 min) and average wake time was 7:53 AM (SD=97 min). Sleep midpoint was positively associated with DNA methylation of CpG sites from the genes REV-VERBA and RORB at the Bonferroni-corrected significance level of p<0.005. The breakfast dietary pattern (rich in eggs, milk, and bread) was inversely associated with DNA methylation at RORA (P=0.003). Conclusion(s): Sleep timing and dietary habits are associated with DNA methylation of core clock genes in adolescents. Epigenetic modification of clock genes could in part underlie relationships between sleep, diet, and metabolic health among adolescents.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,NA,A11,NA,Supplement 1,42,NA,Sleep,NA,"33rd Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies.

Traditional assessment methods, such as polysomnography, sleep diary, and actigraphy, cannot integrate sleep outcome with sleep-related factors by themselves.

We used raw data for predicting sleep with deep learning technology, multi-input one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN). Additionally, we used traditional analysis and machine learning technology to aware which factors affect sleep quality. For this, we used subdivided data into 3 part: wake-up to noon (P1), noon to 18:00 (P2), and 18:00 to bedtime (P3). We performed logistic regression analysis for traditional analysis, and random forest(RF) as machine learning technology.

Most patients with non-diagnostic HSAT studies (AHI < 5/hr) should undergo in-lab PSG due to the risk of false negatives. We previously developed machine learning models to predict which patients are at high risk of a non-diagnostic HSAT using validated patient questionnaires and anthropomorphic measurements collected during routine clinical practice as inputs. The current study extends this work, examining revised machine learning models that incorporate several additional questionnaire items. Method(s): Data from 415 patients undergoing HSAT within the Greater Los Angeles VA were analyzed. Pre-HSAT surveys included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, Patient Health Questionnaire-2, STOPBANG and 13 De novo items (e.g. use of sleep aids and caffeine, sleep schedule, nap frequency, diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]). Data were split into 85% training and 15% testing sets. Missing data (2.3%) was imputed using a k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Random forest and gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) models were trained using the Partial Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (pAUPRC) as the optimization metric. Repeated k-fold cross-validation was used in addition to validation using the heldout test set. Result(s): The GBDT model yielded the best result (pAUPRC on test dataset: 0.628 for GBDT versus 0.606 for random forest). Using the preferred calibration threshold, this model achieved a sensitivity of 0.43 and specificity of 0.96 on the test dataset. The following items significantly improved predictive model performance: 1) rank order representation of patient-reported bedtime and waketime, 2) binary representation of PTSD presence or absence, 3) frequency of sleep aid medication use, 4) number of caffeinated drinks per day, and 5) number of naps per week. These De novo items carried greater predictive value than all other model inputs with the exception of age, body mass index (and its components) and collar size.

Among the metrics reported, Time in Bed (TIB) is essential as it sets the temporal frame for sleep/wake classification. Determining TIB automatically in real-world settings is challenged by behaviors that mimic sleep. We report here a novel algorithm that uses three signal attributes available in leg-worn actigraphy. We use machine learning techniques to optimize algorithm parameters. Method(s): This work is based upon data from 42 subjects collected over 155 nights. Subjects wore the actigraphy device afternoon-to-morning for an average 710 minutes and recorded TIB Start and TIB End in their diary. We developed a three-tiered algorithm. Tier one uses body orientation and step counting to identify upright active intervals. We define the time between these intervals as segments. Tier two is a Bayesian classifier that combines activity, orientation, and time to compute the probability a segment is within TIB. Tier three is a decision tree for gathering sequences of segments that comprise TIB. We fit the Bayesian classifier and applied simulated annealing to the decision tree to minimize the errors in TIB. Result(s): The 155 nights of data included 843 segments. The Bayesian model alone classified 92.9% of segments correctly (Sensitivity = 93.6%, Specificity = 92.5%). After optimizing the decision tree, the complete algorithm classified 97.3% of segments correctly (Sensitivity = 94.0%, Specificity = 98.9%). Accuracy increased partly because because the tree can include segments within TIB that have low probability based on their attributes alone. Visual inspection of residual errors showed that restful behaviors right before sleep remain a challenge. Conclusion(s): In this study we applied machine learning to develop algorithms that combine activity, orientation, and time to estimate TIB for leg-worn actigraphy. The Bayesian model and decision tree were fit to the training population and yielded 97% accuracy for classifying segments within TIB. Future work will explore new segment features, different classifiers, and using within-night and within-subject data to further improve estimates of TIB.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,2022-08-24T07:29:28Z,NA,A405-A406,NA,Supplement 1,42,NA,Sleep,NA,"33rd Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies.

The general practitioner (GP) has no tools to predict the prognosis of early hip complaints, and whether these are the first signs of hip OA. A better knowledge of early signs of hip OA will help to direct proper management for these patients. A widely used and disease-specific standardized questionnaire for hip (and knee) OA is the Western Ontario And McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Unknown is if the WOMAC or specific items of the WOMAC, perhaps in combination with other anamnestic or physical examination measurements, can predict hip OA. Therefore, this study investigated whether an association exists between baseline characteristics (demographic, anamnestic (including WOMAC-questions) and physical examination measurements) and incidence of hip OA within 10 years in people with hip complaints. Method(s): Data were obtained from the Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee (CHECK) study, a nationwide prospective, ten-year follow-up cohort of 1,002 participants (age 45-65; never, or less than six months prior to entry of the study, consulted a physician for those symptoms) with hip/or knee complaints (assumed early symptomatic OA of the knee and/or hip) in the Netherlands. Participants were recruited by a GP or via advertisements in the lay press. All patients completed a questionnaire, underwent physical examination and had standardized hip radiographs at baseline and after 2, 5, 8 and 10 years follow-up. The questionnaires informed on demographics and symptoms (e.g. WOMAC, pain (NRS) and hip pain and physical functioning related questions); the physical examination included flexion of the hip and pain during internal rotation of the hip. Hip OA defined as one of the following criteria: 1. K&L >=2 and pain in one or both hips, or 2. meet the clinical ACR criteria (pain and internal rotation <15degree and flexion of the hip <=115degree or internal rotation >=15degree, pain at internal rotation, stiffness <=60 min, and age <50 years), or 3. received hip replacement follow-up. We included participants with hip pain, without hip OA at baseline (figure 1). The primary outcome was incidence of hip OA defined by one of the three above mentioned definitions during 10 years of follow-up. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the number of variables that were correlated. Components with an Eigen value <1 were chosen. Associations between baseline characteristics (including the PCA-components) and incidence of hip OA were investigated through logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for age, sex and BMI. Result(s): Of all included participants (n=284), 167 participants developed OA during 10 years follow-up and 117 participants did not develop hip OA (figure 1). At baseline mean age was 54.9 years (sd 5.3), mean BMI was 25.9 kg/m2 (sd 3.6), and 81.3% of the subjects were female. Principal component analysis identified four clusters. All WOMAC-questions, questions to asses pain and physical functioning and NRS pain scale were included in the first component, explaining 56% of the variance (Eigen value= 19.7). The second component, explaining 5% of the variance (Eigen value=1.8), can be interpreted as follows: participants with positive scores have pain at rest (pain resting, pain lying in bed and pain nocturnal), but no difficulty climbing stairs. The third component, also explaining 5% of the variance (Eigen value=1.7), can be interpreted as: participants with positive scores have pain during shopping and pain during walking, but have no difficulty putting socks on or off and have no difficulty rising from bed. The fourth included pain during climbing stairs, explaining 3% of the variance (Eigen value =1.2). Associated factors for developing hip OA were higher age (OR 1.06 (95% CI 1.00-1.12) and component 3 (participants having pain during shopping or walking and do not have difficulty putting socks on/off and rising from bed) (OR 1.36 (95% CI 1.02-1.81)) (Table 1). Conclusion(s): This study is one of the first to describe which baseline variables are associated with incidence of hip OA over 10 years of follow-up in participants with early hip complaints (without hip OA at baseline). In this cohort study, we mainly observed that higher age and having pain during shopping and pain during walking, but no difficulty putting socks on or off and no difficulty rising from a bed (component III) were positively associated with incidence of hip OA in participants with recent onset of hip complaints.

Clinicians believe that maladaptive sleep-related factors such as inactivity during daytime, excessive time spent in bed, poor exposure to light, and high stress level contribute development of chronic insomnia [1]. However, there's paucity of evidences which factors are important to sleep. Common ways of acquiring information about sleep and sleep-related factors are polysomnography, sleep diary, and actigraphy. One of the most crucial limitations of them is that prediction of sleep is wholly dependent to a researcher [2]. Moreover, there are no ways to assess stress-related index which is believed to affect sleep. Lastly, traditional assessment methods cannot integrate sleep outcome with sleep-related factors by itself. From this study, we want to find relationship of sleep outcome with sleep-related factors including daytime activity, exposure to light, and stress-related index. Also, we tried to develop algorithm that can predict sleep quality by using machine learning technology. Method(s): Forty-six healthy participants (age 21-61, mean age 31.5, 47.8% male) were enrolled to our study. We measured their sleep and sleep-related factors including daytime activity, exposure to light, and heart rate variability by using actigraphy and heart rate sensor (ActiGraph GT3X and Polar H7) for two weeks. Daytime activity is indicated by the acceleration of the x-, y-, and z axis. We used Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET) as a unit of momentum, and sorted it as vigorous activity (MET>=6), moderate activity (3<=MET<6), and light activity (MET<3). Exposure to light was divided into outside light and inside light. We used pNN50 for heart rate variability, which represents percentage of successive normal sinus RR intervals > 50ms. Subjective sleep quality and information of alcohol or caffeine consumption are assessed by sleep diary. Daytime data was subdivided into 3 part: wake-up to noon (period 1), noon to 18:00 (period 2), and 18:00 to bedtime (period 3). The dependent variable of the analysis was sleep quality (sleep efficiency >=90%). We performed traditional logistic regression analysis which was optimized to maximize accuracy. For machine learning, we used multi-input one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) model [3]. Result(s): By ten times of optimized logistic regression, vigorous activity during period 1, total activity during period 1 and 2, exposure to light during period 1, and exposure to outside light during period 2 showed significant correlations with sleep quality. The effect of stress level on sleep quality was below significance level. Logistic regression's accuracy rate was 71.5% Machine learning algorithm acquired by 1D CNN model showed 73.2% of accuracy rate. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that morning activity, especially vigorous activity, and exposure to any light in morning, and outside light during afternoon are important to sleep quality. And the algorithm made by 1D-CNN model can predict sleep quality accurately which is comparable to the traditional logistic regression. This result can enable more objective and accurate sleep prediction by automation of integration and interpretation of the data.Copyright © 2018",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:29Z,2022-08-24T07:29:29Z,NA,S514,NA,Supplement 1,29,NA,Eur.

B-point detection accuracy can be severely impacted if ICG cardiac cycles corrupted by motion artifact, noise, or electrode displacement are included in the analyses. Here, we developed new algorithms to detect and exclude corrupted ICG cycles by analyzing their level of activity. PEP was then estimated and analyzed on ensemble-averaged clean ICG cycles using an automatic algorithm previously developed by the authors for the detection of B point in awake individuals. We investigated the algorithms' performance relative to expert visual scoring on long-duration data collected from 20 participants during overnight recordings, where the quality of ICG could be highly affected by movement artifacts and electrode displacements and the signal could also vary according to sleep stage and time of night. The artifact rejection algorithm achieved a high accuracy of 87% in detection of expert-identified corrupted ICG cycles, including those with normal amplitude as well as out-of-range values, and was robust to different types and levels of artifact. Intraclass correlations for concurrent validity of the B-point detection algorithm in different sleep stages and in-bed wakefulness exceeded 0.98, indicating excellent agreement with the expert. The algorithms show promise toward sleep applications requiring accurate and reliable automatic measurement of cardiac hemodynamic parameters.Copyright © 2019 Society for Psychophysiological Research.",2019,2022-08-24T07:29:29Z,2022-08-24T07:29:29Z,NA,e13355,NA,7,56,NA,Psychophysiology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed20&NEWS=N&AN=628335077,algorithm; human; adult; female; male; middle aged; signal processing; sleep; hemodynamics; *physiology; heart contraction; impedance cardiography,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is a need to explore new interventions to reduce falls rates, especially in geriatric and general medical wards where older patients and those with cognitive impairment are managed. DESIGN AND METHODS: A three-cluster stepped wedge pragmatic trial, with an embedded qualitative process, of the Ambient Intelligent Geriatric Management (AmbIGeM) system (wearable sensor device to alert staff of patients undertaking at-risk activities), for preventing falls in older patients compared with standard care. The trial will occur on three acute/subacute wards in two hospitals in Adelaide and Perth, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged >65 years admitted to study wards. A waiver (Perth) and opt-out of consent (Adelaide) was obtained for this study. Patients requiring palliative care will be excluded. OUTCOME(S): The primary outcome is falls rate; secondary outcome measures are: (1) proportion of participants falling; (2) rate of injurious inpatient falls/1000 participant bed-days; (3) acceptability and safety of the interventions from patients and clinical staff perspectives; and (4) hospital costs, mortality and use of residential care to 3 months postdischarge. DISCUSSION: This study investigates a novel technological approach to preventing falls in hospitalised older people. We hypothesise that the AmbIGeM intervention will reduce falls and injury rates, with an economic benefit attributable to the intervention. If successful, the AmbIGeM system will be a useful addition to falls prevention in hospital wards with high proportions of older people and people with cognitive impairment. : Trial registration NUMBER: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry: ACTRN 12617000981325; Pre-results.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

The aim of this study was to study how effective smart garment fabrics could be capturing physiological signs in a non-contact mode. The present work demonstrates a feasible approach of, instead of using conventional high-power illumination sources, integrating a grid of surface-mounted light emitting diodes (LEDs) into cotton fabric to spotlight the region of interest (ROI). The green and the red LEDs (525 and 660 nm) placed on a small cotton substrate were used to locally illuminate palm skin in a dual-wavelength iPPG setup, where the backscattered light is transmitted to a remote image sensor through the garment fabric. The results show that the illuminations from both wavelength LEDs can be used to extract heart rate (HR) reaching an accuracy of 90% compared to a contact PPG probe. Stretching the fabric over the skin surface alters the morphology of iPPG signals, demonstrating a significantly higher pulsatile amplitude in both channels of green and red illuminations. The skin compression by the fabric could be potentially utilised to enhance the penetration of illumination into cutaneous microvascular beds. The outcome could lead a new avenue of non-contact opto-physiological monitoring and assessment with functional garment fabrics.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:29Z,2022-08-24T07:29:29Z,NA,33,NA,2,8,NA,Biosensors,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Switzerland Publisher: MDPI,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed19&NEWS=N&AN=621492480,article; human; adult; female; male; controlled study; measurement accuracy; process development; human experiment; signal processing; illumination; heart rate; photoelectric plethysmography; biosensor; *physiologic monitoring; *general medical device; *smart garment fabric; light emitting diode; light intensity; microcirculation; process monitoring,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aims to examine performance criteria (i.e.; sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy) for fall prediction resulting from a nurse assessment and an artificial neural networks (ANNs) analysis in older inpatients hospitalized in acute care medical wards. Method(s): A total of 848 older inpatients (mean age, 83.0+/-7.2 years; 41.8% female) admitted to acute care medical wards in Angers University hospital (France) were included in this study using an observational prospective cohort design. Within 24 hours after admission of older inpatients, nurses performed a bedside clinical assessment. Participants were separated into non-fallers and fallers (i.e.; >=1 fall during hospitalization stay). The analysis was conducted using three feed forward ANNs (multilayer perceptron [MLP], averaged neural network, and neuroevolution of augmenting topologies [NEAT]). Result(s): Seventy-three (8.6%) participants fell at least once during their hospital stay. ANNs showed a high specificity, regardless of which ANN was used, and the highest value reported was with MLP (99.8%). In contrast, sensitivity was lower, with values ranging between 98.4 to 14.8%. MLP had the highest accuracy (99.7). Conclusion(s): Performance criteria for fall prediction resulting from a bedside nursing assessment and an ANNs analysis was associated with a high specificity but a low sensitivity, suggesting that this combined approach should be used more as a diagnostic test than a screening test when considering older inpatients in acute care medical ward.Copyright © 2018, Serdi and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:29Z,2022-08-24T07:29:29Z,NA,131-137,NA,1,22,NA,J.

We aimed to describe and investigate variation in chimpanzee nest architecture across two populations in response to local weather conditions. Material(s) and Method(s): We experimentally tested whether nests provide insulation by measuring heat loss within and outside nests, and took detailed measurements of the number, size, and type of materials used in nest building across two dry-habitat research sites (Fongoli, Senegal, and Issa, Tanzania). We tested application of principal components analysis (PCA) to extract composite quantitative measures of the key components of shape and architecture, before testing how PCs vary across populations with overnight weather conditions that reflect hypothesized thermoregulatory function. Result(s): Heat loss is greater and occurs faster outside of nests. PCA allowed meaningful comparison of nests within and between sites. Nest variation at both sites revealed chimpanzees built thicker nests in cooler conditions and used more broken branches and support in moister conditions. Chimpanzees in Fongoli used more lining and mattress material in colder conditions, whilst in Issa nest depth and support branch size were larger in windier conditions. Discussion(s): Shape and architectural measures reflected insulation and stability of nest structure. Chimpanzees in Fongoli and Issa may achieve the same functional goals by adjusting nest shape and architecture in different ways. These results suggest that wild chimpanzees show flexible building techniques in response to local, overnight weather conditions in making an insulating and stable, supportive platform for sleep.Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:29Z,2022-08-24T07:29:29Z,NA,549-562,NA,3,166,NA,Am.

However, traditional methods in recording physiological change amidst sleep is difficult without being intrusive. The smart pillow is developed to provide a relatively easy way to observe one's sleep condition, employing temperature and humidity sensors by implanting them inside the pillow in strategic positions. With the patient's head on the pillow, the roles of sensors are identified as main, auxiliary or environmental temperature, based on the differences of value from three temperature sensors, thus the pattern of sleep can be extracted by statistical analysis, and the body temperature is inferred by a specially designed Fuzzy Logic System if the head-on position is stable for more than 15 min. Night sweat is reported on data from the humidity sensor. Therefore, a cloud-based health-sensing system is built in the smart pillow to collect and analyze data.

Some can be prevented by using measures such as specialty beds, which are not feasible for every patient because of costs. However, decisions about which patient would benefit most from a specialty bed are difficult because results of existing tools to determine risk for pressure injury indicate that most critical care patients are at high risk. OBJECTIVE(S): To develop a model for predicting development of pressure injuries among surgical critical care patients. METHOD(S): Data from electronic health records were divided into training (67%) and testing (33%) data sets, and a model was developed by using a random forest algorithm via the R package ""randomforest."" RESULTS: Among a sample of 6376 patients, hospital-acquired pressure injuries of stage 1 or greater (outcome variable 1) developed in 516 patients (8.1%) and injuries of stage 2 or greater (outcome variable 2) developed in 257 (4.0%). Random forest models were developed to predict stage 1 and greater and stage 2 and greater injuries by using the testing set to evaluate classifier performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for both models was 0.79. CONCLUSION(S): This machine-learning approach differs from other available models because it does not require clinicians to input information into a tool (eg, the Braden Scale). Rather, it uses information readily available in electronic health records. Next steps include testing in an independent sample and then calibration to optimize specificity.Copyright ©2018 American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:29Z,2022-08-24T07:29:29Z,NA,461-468,NA,6,27,NA,Am.

A method for automatic detection of snoring in whole-night recordings is required to enable its quantitative evaluation. In this study, we propose such a method. The centerpiece of the proposed method is a recurrent neural network for modeling of sequential data with variable length.

Different combinations of parameters were studied to determine the best configuration. Data were collected on four major postures from 58 subjects. We report the results of classification for different combinations of these four postures. Both 10-Fold and Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) Cross-validations (CV) were used to evaluate the accuracy of our predictions. Our results show that there are multiple configuration settings that make classification accuracy as high as 100% using k-Fold CV for all postures. Maximum classification accuracy after applying LOSO is 93% for a two-class classification of separating Left vs. Right lateral positions. The second-best classification accuracy with LOSO is 92% for the classification of lateral versus non-lateral.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:30Z,2022-08-24T07:29:30Z,NA,461-465,NA,NA,2018,NA,Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed19&NEWS=N&AN=625012475,human; sleep; *artificial neural network; *body position; *bed; transducer,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences",NA,1758-535X (electronic),10.1093/gerona/glw250,NA,"Background: There is growing interest in the area of ""wearable tech"" and its relationship to health. A common element of many of these devices is a triaxial accelerometer that can yield continuous information on gross motor activity levels; how such data might predict changes in health is less clear. Method(s): We examined accelerometry data from 2,976 older men who were part of the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. Using a shape-naive technique, functional principal component analysis, we examined the patterns of motor activity over the course of 4-7 days and determined whether these patterns were associated with changes in polysomnographic-determined sleep and cognitive function (Trail Making Test-Part B [Trails B], Modified Mini-Mental State Examination [3MS]), as well as mortality over 6.5-8 years of follow-up. Result(s): In comparing baseline to 6.5 years later, multivariate modeling indicated that low daytime activity at baseline was associated with worsening of sleep efficiency (p < .05), more wake after sleep onset (p < .05), and a decrease in cognition (Trails B; p < .001), as well as a 1.6-fold higher rate of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.64 [1.34-2.00]). Earlier wake and bed times were associated with a decrease in cognition (3MS; p < .05). Having a late afternoon peak in activity was associated with a 1.4-fold higher rate of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.46 [1.21-1.77]). Those having a longer duration of their daytime activity with a bimodal activity pattern also had over a 1.4-fold higher rate of cardiovascular-related mortality (hazard ratio = 1.42 [1.02-1.98]). Conclusion(s): Patterns of daily activity may be useful as predictive biomarkers for changes in clinically relevant outcomes, including mortality and changes in sleep and cognition in older men.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:30Z,2022-08-24T07:29:30Z,NA,682-687,NA,5,73,NA,J.

APPROACH: This study comprised 50 participants, aged 65-85 years. Fourteen automated algorithms were developed. Participants reported their bedtime and waking time on the days on which they wore the device. A well-trained expert reviewed each IDEEA file in order to visually identify bedtime and waking time on each day. To explore the agreement between methods, Pearson correlations, mean differences, mean percentage errors, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, and the Bland-Altman method were calculated. MAIN RESULTS: With 87 d of valid data, algorithms 6, 7, 11 and 12 achieved higher levels of agreement in determining sleep period time when compared to self-reported data (mean difference=-0.34 to 0.01h d-1; mean absolute error=10.66%-11.44%; r=0.515-0.686; accuracy=95.0%-95.6%; sensitivity=93.0%-95.8%; specificity=95.7%-96.4%) and expert visual analysis (mean difference=-0.04 to 0.31h d-1; mean absolute error=5.0%-6.97%; r=0.620-0.766; accuracy=97.2%-98.0%; sensitivity=94.5%-97.6%; specificity=98.4%-98.8%). Bland-Altman plots showed no systematic biases in these comparisons (all p>0.05). Differences between methods did not vary significantly by gender, age, obesity, self-rated health, or the presence of chronic conditions. SIGNIFICANCE: These four algorithms can be used to identify easily and with adequate accuracy the sleep period time using the IDEEA activity monitor from 24h free-living data in older adults.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:30Z,2022-08-24T07:29:30Z,NA,055002,NA,5,39,NA,Physiol Meas,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United Kingdom Publisher: NLM (Medline),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed19&NEWS=N&AN=626705626,human; female; male; aged; very elderly; automation; sleep; wakefulness; *algorithm; actimetry; *physiology; *devices; *automated pattern recognition,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In asthma, a misapprehension of health between exacerbations can compromise compliance. Thus, there is a need for a tool that permits objective longitudinal monitoring without increasing the burden of patient compliance. Objective(s): We sought to determine whether changes in nocturnal physiology are associated with asthma symptoms in pediatric patients. Method(s): Using a contactless bed sensor, nocturnal heart rate (HR), respiratory rate, relative stroke volume, and movement in children with asthma 5-18 years of age (n = 16) were recorded. Asthma symptoms and asthma control test (ACT) score were reported every 2 weeks. Random forest model was used to identify physiologic parameters associated with asthma symptoms. Elastic net regression was used to identify variables associated with ACT score. Measurements and Main Results: The model on the full cohort performed with sensitivity of 47.2%, specificity of 96.3%, and accuracy of 87.4%; HR and respiratory parameters were the most important variables in this model. The model predicted asthma symptoms 35% of the time on the day before perception of symptoms, and 100% of the time for a select subject for which the model performed with greater sensitivity. Multivariable and bivariable analyses demonstrated significant association between HR and respiratory rate parameters and ACT score. Conclusion(s): Nocturnal physiologic changes correlate with asthma symptoms, supporting the notion that nocturnal physiologic monitoring represents an objective diagnostic tool capable of longitudinally assessing disease control and predicting asthma exacerbations in children with asthma at home.Copyright © 2018 by the American Thoracic Society",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:30Z,2022-08-24T07:29:30Z,NA,320-328,NA,3,198,NA,Am.

How the encoding of declarative memories during subsequent wakefulness might benefit from their enhancement during sleep is less clear. In this study, we investigated the impact of acoustically enhanced SO during a nap on subsequent encoding of declarative material. Method(s): Thirty-seven healthy young adults were studied under two conditions: stimulation (STIM) and no stimulation (SHAM), in counter-balanced order following a night of sleep restriction (4 hr time-in-bed [TIB]). In the STIM condition, auditory tones were phase-locked to the SO up-state during a 90 min nap opportunity. In the SHAM condition, corresponding time points were marked but tones were not presented. Thirty minutes after awakening, participants encoded pictures while undergoing fMRI. Picture recognition was tested 60 min later. Result(s): Acoustic stimulation augmented SO across the group, but there was no group level benefit on memory. However, the magnitude of SO enhancement correlated with greater recollection. SO enhancement was also positively correlated with hippocampal activation at encoding. Although spindle activity increased, this did not correlate with memory benefit or shift in hippocampal signal. Conclusion(s): Acoustic stimulation during a nap can benefit encoding of declarative memories. Hippocampal activation positively correlated with SO augmentation.Copyright © Sleep Research Society 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Sleep Research Society.

This avalanche of unreliable alerts causes clinicians to experience sensory overload when attempting to sort real from false alarms, causing desensitization and alarm fatigue, which in turn leads to adverse events when true instability is neither recognized nor attended to despite the alarm. The scope of the problem of alarm fatigue is broad, and its contributing mechanisms are numerous. Current and future approaches to defining and reacting to actionable and non-actionable alarms are being developed and investigated, but challenges in impacting alarm modalities, sensitivity and specificity, and clinical activity in order to reduce alarm fatigue and adverse events remain. A multi-faceted approach involving clinicians, computer scientists, industry, and regulatory agencies is needed to battle alarm fatigue.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:30Z,2022-08-24T07:29:30Z,NA,S44-S48,NA,6 Supplement,51,NA,J.

Most of the existing techniques for sleeping posture recognition used force-sensitive resistor (FSR) sensors. However, lower limbs cannot be recognized accurately unless thousands of sensors are deployed on the bedsheet. Method(s): We designed a sleeping posture recognition scheme in which FSR sensors were deployed on the upper part of the bedsheet to record the pressure distribution of the upper body. In addition, an infrared array sensor was deployed to collect data for the lower body. Posture recognition was performed using a fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. Six types of sleeping body posture were recognized from the combination of the upper and lower body postures. Result(s): The experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of above 88%. Moreover, the proposed scheme is cost-efficient and easy to deploy. Conclusion(s): The proposed sleeping posture recognition system can be used for pressure ulcer prevention and sleep quality assessment.

This research is focused on the development of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems, using mobile devices for the acquisition of the different types of data related to the physical and physiological conditions of the subjects and the environments. Mobile devices with the Android Operating Systems are the least expensive and exhibit the biggest market while providing a variety of models and onboard sensors. Objective(s): This paper describes the implementation considerations, challenges and solutions about a framework for the recognition of ADL and the environments, provided as an Android library. The framework is a function of the number of sensors available in different mobile devices and utilizes a variety of activity recognition algorithms to provide a rapid feedback to the user. Method(s): The Android library includes data fusion, data processing, features engineering and classification methods. The sensors that may be used are the accelerometer, the gyroscope, the magnetometer, the Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and the microphone. The data processing includes the application of data cleaning methods and the extraction of features, which are used with Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for the classification of ADL and environment. Throughout this work, the limitations of the mobile devices were explored and their effects have been minimized. Result(s): The implementation of the Android library reported an overall accuracy between 58.02% and 89.15%, depending on the number of sensors used and the number of ADL and environments recognized. Compared with the results available in the literature, the performance of the library reported a mean improvement of 2.93%, and they do not differ at the maximum found in prior work, that based on the Student's t-test. Conclusion(s): This study proves that ADL like walking, going upstairs and downstairs, running, watching TV, driving, sleeping and standing activities, and the bedroom, cooking/kitchen, gym, classroom, hall, living room, bar, library and street environments may be recognized with the sensors available in off-the-shelf mobile devices. Finally, these results may act as a preliminary research for the development of a personal digital life coach with a multi-sensor mobile device commonly used daily.Copyright © 2018 Pires et al.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,NA,61-88,NA,1,11,NA,Open Bioinformatics J.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: Netherlands Publisher: Bentham Science Publishers B.V.

Doctors will be able to use this in the examination room, at a patient's bedside, or in an entirely different location. Currently, analysis of patient data is done mostly by the doctor; however, huge progress in computer hardware performance and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms has allowed the development of new methods used to analyze and classify patient examination results. In the same way that doctors learn and practice how to treat patients during their studies, algorithms can learn to spot abnormalities, allowing current technology and advanced AI algorithms to be joined in one high-Tech solution that should provide initial assessment of patients' health and give treatment guidance, if necessary.Copyright © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2018.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,NA,20180007,NA,2,14,NA,Bio-Algorithms Med-Syst.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Germany Publisher: Walter de Gruyter GmbH,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed19&NEWS=N&AN=622811553,article; human; priority journal; physician; *cardiovascular monitoring device; *heart rate monitor; *holography; anatomical concepts,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This allowed us to extract the benefits of using the calibrated touch interface to move the wheelchair. The advantage of this control is that it allows the patient to drive the wheelchair with a precise variable speed like a traditional motorized joystick with less effort. We have set up a two-way communication between the tablet and the control system. This allows us not only to control the wheelchair, but also to detect and treat communication errors as a sudden disconnection. In this case, the wheelchair stops and waits for the user to take further action. The use of Wi-Fi has many advantages since it is a lighting solution and the user can even park the wheelchair in his room when he is lying in bed. Result(s): We can notice that users are faster with the intelligent touch joystick than with the mechanical joystick. This is because less muscular effort is required on the first than on a mechanical joystick, the user only uses his finger to move the chair. Moreover, the advantage of using the neural network ensures increased speed and stability of movement even if the user has the impression that his finger is in the wrong direction on the interface and that his speed is reduced because of his pathology. In fact, one of the expected results was that the tablet maintained constant speed longer than the standard mechanical joystick. This can be explained by the fact that it is easier with the tablet to maintain a maximum speed while correcting the trajectory deviation with a minimum effort. Conclusion(s): In this article, we explored an intelligent touchscreen solution that will address the problems faced by our target users. We conducted a thorough research on the types of existing control interfaces. We found that most of these interfaces use a discrete control of speed and direction. After testing it with a group of disabled users, we noticed the importance of analogic control. As part of our iterative design approach, we designed a prototype that provides this analogic control and in which we have implemented a calibration algorithm based on the neural networks algorithm.Copyright © 2018 AGBM",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,NA,180-193,NA,3,39,NA,IRBM,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: France Publisher: Elsevier Masson SAS (62 rue Camille Desmoulins, Issy les Moulineaux Cedex 92442, France)",NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed19&NEWS=N&AN=2000718917,artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; article; human; adolescent; male; aged; motor dysfunction; clinical article; smartphone; simulator; velocity; case report; movement (physiology); muscle function; hand movement; *brain computer interface; *powered wheelchair; handedness,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evidence of the risk of cancer risk has since strengthened. Exposure is changing due to the rapid development of technology resulting in increased ambient radiation. RF radiation of sufficient intensity heats tissues, but the energy is insufficient to cause ionization, hence it is called non-ionizing radiation. These non-thermal exposure levels have resulted in biological effects in humans, animals and cells, including an increased cancer risk. In the present study, the levels of RF radiation were measured in an apartment close to two groups of mobile phone base stations on the roof. A total of 74,531 measurements were made corresponding to ~83 h of recording. The total mean RF radiation level was 3,811 microW/m2 (range 15.2-112,318 microW/m2) for the measurement of the whole apartment, including balconies. Particularly high levels were measured on three balconies and 3 of 4 bedrooms. The total mean RF radiation level decreased by 98% when the measured down-links from the base stations for 2, 3 and 4 G were disregarded. The results are discussed in relation to the detrimental health effects of non-thermal RF radiation. Due to the current high RF radiation, the apartment is not suitable for long-term living, particularly for children who may be more sensitive than adults. For a definitive conclusion regarding the effect of RF radiation from nearby base stations, one option would be to turn them off and repeat the measurements. However, the simplest and safest solution would be to turn them off and dismantle them.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications.

This paper presents a model using convolution dictionary learning to extract features from physiological data available from bedside monitors. We develop and validate a prediction model for DCI after SAH, demonstrating improved precision over standard methods alone. Method(s): 488 consecutive SAH admissions from 2006 to 2014 to a tertiary care hospital were included. Models were trained on 80%, while 20% were set aside for validation testing. Modified Fisher Scale was considered the standard grading scale in clinical use; baseline features also analyzed included age, sex, Hunt-Hess, and Glasgow Coma Scales. An unsupervised approach using convolution dictionary learning was used to extract features from physiological time series (systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation). Classifiers (partial least squares and linear and kernel support vector machines) were trained on feature subsets of the derivation dataset. Models were applied to the validation dataset. Result(s): The performances of the best classifiers on the validation dataset are reported by feature subset. Standard grading scale (mFS): AUC 0.54. Combined demographics and grading scales (baseline features): AUC 0.63. Kernel derived physiologic features: AUC 0.66. Combined baseline and physiologic features with redundant feature reduction: AUC 0.71 on derivation dataset and 0.78 on validation dataset. Conclusion(s): Current DCI prediction tools rely on admission imaging and are advantageously simple to employ. However, using an agnostic and computationally inexpensive learning approach for high-frequency physiologic time series data, we demonstrated that we could incorporate individual physiologic data to achieve higher classification accuracy.Copyright © 2018 Megjhani, Terilli, Frey, Velazquez, Doyle, Connolly, Roh, Agarwal, Claassen, Elhadad and Park.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,NA,122,NA,MAR,9,NA,Front.

Reduced and fragmented sleep can impact pathology, worsen other symptoms, and significantly affect daytime functioning. Additionally, poor sleep quality may be a risk factor of many neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease (Ju et al. 2014). While polysomnography (PSG) remains the gold standard for sleep assessment, it is costly, often recorded on an isolated night with no daytime assessment, and may not be feasible in many clinical trials. The increasing availability of wearable sensor technology offers a practical, non-intrusive means of collecting continuous sleep-wake data, over several days. This provides digital biomarkers from real world settings that can be used to predict risk, detect symptoms and monitor changes in sleep and activity. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to examine relationships between actigraphy-derived and self-reported sleep diary measurements within an epidemiology study cohort of elderly subjects. Method(s): We analyzed actigraphy and sleep diary data, available for 22 subjects (Age: Mean=80.6, SD=9.9; 68% female) from a study of sleep difficulties, lifestyle factors and general health in the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Montpellier - France. All subjects were asked to wear an Axivity 3-axis accelerometry biosensor device (http://axivity.com/) on their non-dominant wrist for 14 nights and to complete sleep diaries for the same 2-week period. IXICO's fully integrated wearables work-flow (Figure 1) was employed for data analysis. This incorporated quality control (QC) for periods of perceived device non-wear. In-bed periods were estimated with the McVeigh algorithm (McVeigh et al. 2016) and sleep and wake periods with the Cole-Kripke (CK) algorithm (Cole et al. 1992). Correlations between the actigraphy- and self-reported sleep measurements were assessed sample-wise, for all nights with both types of data available. As part of a quantitative QC, unrealistic night-time in-bed periods of <2.5 and >13 hours (N=17) were excluded from subsequent analysis, as well as self-reported nights with <1 hour of sleep (N=2). This resulted in 141 nights' data for the statistical analysis. Correlations (Pearson's R/Spearman's Rho) were calculated between four variables available from both actigraphy and the diaries: sleep efficiency/quality, total time in bed, night-time in-bed sleep and number of awakenings. Result(s): Actigraphy-derived sleep efficiency correlated with self-reported sleep quality at r = .16 (p = .06; Figure 2). McVeigh-estimated times in bed at night and self-reported times from into-bed to out-of-bed correlated at r = .32 (p = .0001). CK-estimated in-bed sleep times and selfreported times from lights-out to awakening (minus sleep onset latency) correlated at r = .15 (p = .07). As expected, the number of estimated night-time awakenings was considerably higher from actigraphy (median=13, IQR=11) than from the diaries (median=2, IQR=2), with these measurements correlated at r = .06 (p = .51). Conclusion(s): The relatively low correlations between sleep diaries and actigraphy measures reported here may implicate poor reliability and inaccuracy of self-reported sleep measures (see e.g. Goelema et al. 2017). However, as selfreported awakenings may include lying still in bed, the higher number of actigraphy-derived awakenings may be partially explained by interpretation of the minute-wise sleep/no-sleep labeling from the algorithm: a period of wakefulness being split into several if quiet wakefulness is labelled as asleep. With sleep efficiency, we have previously shown in the same cohort that measures derived from 1-night accelerometry recordings using the CK algorithm (as above) correlated at r = .61 (p = .003) with simultaneous PSG (Wolz et al. 2017). Using a welldesigned work-flow, actigraphy can provide objective realworld measures of sleep and activity from data collected over 14 days or longer, with minimal patient discomfort and acceptable QC failure rates. Although PSG can be used to assess sleep stages, apnea/hypopnea indexes and periodic leg movements, the advantages of actigraphy over traditional PSG include the well-tolerated continuous recording in real life settings and relative cost-effectiveness. The current results suggest that compared to sleep diaries, actigraphy can offer an attractive and more reliable alternative for the measurement of signs and symptoms of disease, or the evaluation of therapeutic effects. Customized data analytics, including disease-specific models, have the potential to detect sleep disturbance more accurately than widely used algorithms such as the CK, which may incorrectly interpret periods of quiet wakefulness as sleep. In the Wolz et al. (2017) 1-night study, we found the IXICO Deep Learning Sleep (DLS) algorithm to outperform the CK in estimating PSG-derived sleep efficiency (DLS: r = .84, p < .0001 vs. CK: r = .61, p = .003). Our approach of combining actigraphy with advanced data analytics shows promise for providing improved biomarkers of sleep, circadian rhythm and activity outcomes in clinical trials. In future work, we will employ the DLS algorithm to estimate sleep efficiency in elderly populations and neurodegenerative disease cohorts and will extend the presented statistical analysis to include daytime naps and an assessment of variability between night and day activity/sleep over the 14 day period.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,NA,S109-S110,NA,1,5,NA,J.

Bedside alerts are issued whenever patient vital signs (VS) exceed a threshold but do not indicate potential severity of the emerging instability. This limits their clinical utility. OBJECTIVES. We propose a model-based approach to differentiate cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) manifested by VS derangement that is mild and in need solely of nurse awareness or intervention (Min-CRI), versus more severe cases that require escalation of care (SevCRI). METHODS. We collected continuous noninvasive VS monitoring data (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, SpO2) from 326 step-down unit (SDU) patients and reviewed data time-plots for 1087 real alerts across normal VS thresholds defining CRI. Two clinical experts (RN and MD) independently labeled those CRI events with increasing severity (level 1: mild, nurse needs to be aware; level 2: in need of nurse encounter and intervention; level 3: in need of routine care escalation to an MD; level 4: in need of immediate care escalation to a Medical Emergency Team). We fit a multi-class random forest model to the data using statistical features extracted during the alert periods and evaluated it via cross-validation. We also tested the model on a separate sample of 85 alerts from a different patient cohort. We compared the estimated CRI severity levels with those independently provided by the experts. RESULTS. The overall accuracy of predicting CRI severity level is 72.8% as measured with leave-one-patient-out cross validation (Figure 1). The vast majority (89.9%) of classification errors are made with respect to neighboring severity levels. By grouping levels 1 with 2 (to form MinCRI, requiring nurse awareness/intervention) and 3 with 4 (SevCRI requiring escalation of care; the positive class), the accuracy of the resulting binarized prediction model increases to 91.6% with a true positive rate of 77.9% and false positive rate of 2.3%. If, however, we increase the tolerance level of the false positive rate to 10%, the true positive rate is 86.0%. When testing the model on the external validation set, among the 53 MinCRI identified by the model, 90.6% were correctly classified, as well as 80.3% of the 32 model-identified SevCRI cases. The overall inter-rater agreement between two experts for the severity labels is 0.83 (Weighted Cohen's kappa). CONCLUSIONS. A model trained from annotated historical VS data can discern between instability severity patterns in need of nurse at-tention versus those requiring care escalation. Such models, if em-bedded in real-time monitoring systems, could assist bedside clinical decision making regarding care escalation and resource allocation.

In the intensive care. unit, Acute Hypotensive Episodes (AHE) represent a phenomenon of high clinical relevance. If not promptly treated, AHEs may lead to critical conditions, and they are associated with a more than double mortality rate compared to normopressive subjects and side effects of late treatment (e.g irreversible organs damage) [1]. AHE prediction has been the subject of several previous studies, showing it is possible to predict such events. We present a method that, by means of machine learning and a statistical model framework, predicts AHE onset by several minutes using information from ECG and Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) recordings. Additionally, we proved that by introducing variables related to baroreflex sensitivity (BRFX) in the previous model we were able to improve the quality of the prediction (AUC) by 9.8%. OBJECTIVES. The aim of this study is to predict the onset of AHE using a mathematical framework applied on ECG and ABP waveforms from bedside Monitor recordings of ICU patients. METHODS. We define an AHE by the 2009 Physionet Challenge definition: 30 minutes interval in which 90% of MAP is below 60mmHg [1]. Data were pulled from the MIMIC-II Waveforms Database. The final cohort counted 83 records, of which 32 (38.55%) hypotensive. The first model (Model A) we deployed was based solely on blood pressure variables, whereas in the second (Model B) we introduced BRFX Features. BRFX was estimated using a bivariate point process framework based on a closed-loop Heart Rate (HR)-Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) model [2]. Following several processing stages, we extracted indicators describing BRFX activity. The prediction was performed 10 minutes ahead of the AHE onset, using 10 minutes worth of data (time windows starting 20 minutes before the AHE onset and ending 10 minutes prior) using Linear Discriminant Analysis. RESULTS. Model A obtained an AUC of.74, while Model B further improved results (AUC) by as much as 9.8%. CONCLUSIONS. Results from this study show that it is possible to extract relevant information from a beat-to-beat analysis, able to generate a prediction by using only 10 minutes of data previous to the event. Additionally, the inclusion of BRFX further improves the outcome. Indeed, machine Learning is proving to be an extremely useful tool for supporting clinicians in critical care, although further improvements are still advocated, towards even more accurate outcomes.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,NA,NA,NA,Supplement 2,6,NA,Intensive Care Med.

Existing clinical diagnosis requires overnight in-facility monitoring of sleep which is costly and resource intensive. However, the impact of reduced airway muscle tone in makes REM sleep more vulnerable to severe OSA which warrants in depth analysis of sleep stages. Furthermore, OSA severity variation can be attributed by male-female differences in the airway characteristics. Limited evidence suggests that women have higher OSA in REM sleep even though classic OSA symptoms are less present in women. Hence, the purpose of this ongoing study is to develop a simple and low cost OSA diagnosis technique which will indentify males and females with OSA in individual sleep states. Considering the emerging evidence of snoring sound in relation to the upper airway collapse in OSA patients, we used snoring as a low cost measure. Method(s): Our study included a total of 91 patients (Age 50.84 +/- 12.87 Year, Male/Female 56/35, AHI 33.86 +/- 28.37 events/hr) referred to the hospital with history of nocturnal snoring and symptomatic OSA. We collected non-contact audio recording through a pair of bedside microphone along with simultaneous Polysomnography (PSG) recording. Individual snoring events were then extracted by applying a pattern recognition based technique on audio data and then each was labeled as either from REM or NREM sleep with the help of an artificial neural network based algorithm. A set of Logistic regression models (LRM) were developed to train on the properties of REM and NREM snore group from the male and female patients and then test on a separate snore group by following a leave-one patient-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique. We used two cut-off-points for OSA in REM and NREM sleep (i.e., Apnea and hypopnea index (AHI) <= 15 events/h and AHI <= 30 events/h). Then PSG based clinical parameters such as blood pressure and arousal index (ArI) of males and females were assessed between REM/NREM OSA groups for categorizing patients at risks of co-morbidities. Result(s): The performance of our LRM models achieved 80-81% and 75-85% accuracy respectively for NRME and REM OSA prediction. As primary outcome of interest, inclusion of gender in LRM model development has increased the accuracies to 88-91% for both NREM and NREM cases. Importantly, when PSG based clinical parameters such as blood pressure and ArI were analyzed between the male and female OSA group categorized by LRM models, females with REM OSA showed higher SBP than males (ANOVA test p value <0.005). Discussion(s): Variation in REM/NREM prediction accuracy and association with clinical parameters shows that gender predominates in OSA severity and its clinical presentation. Complaint of depression and anxiety in females may link high SBP. Hence, our non-contact SS based approach could be of utility for better estimate OSA severity, suitable for home diagnosis and monitoring and early screening of patients at risk.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,2022-08-24T07:29:31Z,NA,NA,NA,Supplement 2,27,NA,J.

Untreated OSA is associated with increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, stroke and type 2 diabetes. It is estimated that 80% of people suffering from moderate and severe OSA remain undiagnosed. The current standard of diagnosis, attended laboratory polysomnography (PSG), and its portable variants are not feasible for mass screening or long-term monitoring due to high cost, complexity of instrumentation and inconvenience to patients. Accurate and low-cost OSA screening technologies appropriate for mass deployment are urgently needed. We conducted a large sample feasibility study of a smartphone based screening tool for OSA. Method(s): Consecutive patients undergoing PSG at two sleep laboratories in Perth, Western Australia were approached for participation in this feasibility study utilising machine-learning algorithms developed to characterise the severity of OSA from a patient's overnight breathing and snoring sounds recorded using a smartphone placed on a bedside table. The algorithms were trained and validated using sounds recorded during simultaneous AASM Type-1 PSG. PSG data were scored per 2012 AASM criteria and the Apnoea Hypopnea Index (AHI) was used as the reference metric for comparison of results. Ten-fold cross validation was used to test the performance of the method. Result(s): 731 subjects were recruited, 62% males; age range 18-87 years (mean 53) and an AHI range 0-196/h (mean 24). The algorithms achieved 86% sensitivity and 83% specificity in identifying OSA at the diagnostic threshold of AHI=15/h. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.91. Similar results were obtained at the threshold AHI=30/h. Discussion(s): Results obtained on this large cohort of subjects indicate that snoring and breathing sounds carry vital information, which can be used to screen for or diagnose OSA. It illustrates the feasibility of using sound analysis to develop a smartphone based scalable and accurate OSA screening tool suitable for mass deployment.

Early detection and access to the history of a fall is crucial for efficient care and secondary prevention in cognitively impaired individuals. However, most falls remain unwitnessed events, and why and how a fall happened in a patient with dementia is a challenge. Computer vision, video-capture and secure transmission of real-world falls stands thus as a promising assistive tool for people with dementia. We report here on a new technology developing artificial intelligence for managed dementia care to reduce the frequency and impact of falls, the leading case of hospitalization in dementia. The objective of the study was to analyze how continuous video-monitoring and review of falls can support better quality of care in dementia. Method(s): A pilot observational study (July-September 2016) was carried out in a Californian memory care facility. Falls were video-captured (24/24, 7/7) thanks to 43 wall-mounted cameras (deployed in all common areas and in 10 out of 40 private bedrooms of consenting residents and families). Video-review was provided to facility staff thanks to a customized mobile device application. The outcome measures were the count of residents' falls happening in the video-covered areas, the acceptability of video-recording, the analysis of video-review and -replay possibilities for care practice. A second study (October 2017- ongoing) including over 10 Californian memory care facilities is underway. Result(s): Regarding the pilot study, 16 falls were video-captured over three months. A drop in fall rate was observed in the last month. Acceptability was good. Video-review enabled screening for the severity of falls and fall-related-injuries. Video-replay enabled identifying cognitive-behavioral deficiencies and environmental circumstances contributing to the fall. This allowed for secondary prevention in high-risk multi-faller individuals and for updated facility care policies regarding a safer living environment for all residents. More data about how computer vision for managed Alzheimer's care can reduce the frequency and impact of safety-critical events will be available soon to complement these pilot results. Conclusion(s): Video-monitoring offers high potential to support conventional care in memory care facilities.Copyright © 2018",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,NA,P188,NA,7 Supplement,14,NA,Alzheimer's Dementia,NA,Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2018.

However, there's paucity of evidences which factors are important to sleep. Moreover, traditional assessment methods cannot integrate sleep outcome with sleeprelated factors by itself. We want to find relationship of sleep outcome with sleep-related factors including daytime activity, exposure to light, and stress-related index. Also, we tried to develop algorithm that can predict sleep quality by using machine learning technology. Method(s): Forty-six healthy participants (mean age 31.5, 47.8% male) were enrolled to our study. We measured their sleep and sleep-related factors by using actigraphy and heart rate sensor for two weeks. We used metabolic equivalent of task (MET), and sorted it as vigorous activity (MET>=6), moderate activity (3<=MET< 6), and light activity (MET< 3). Exposure to light was divided into outside light and inside light. For heart rate variability, we used pNN50. Alcohol and caffeine consumption were assessed by sleep diary. Daytime data was subdivided into 3 part: wake-up to noon (period 1), noon to 18:00 (period 2), and 18:00 to bedtime (period 3). The dependent variable of the analysis was sleep quality(sleep efficiency >=90%). We performed logistic regression analysis which was optimized to maximize accuracy. For machine learning, we used multiinput one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) model. Result(s): By ten times of optimized logistic regression, vigorous activity during period 1, total activity during period 1 and 2, exposure to light during period 1, and exposure to outside light during period 2 showed significant correlations with sleep quality. The effect of stress level on sleep quality was below significance level. Logistic regression's accuracy rate was 71.5% Machine learning algorithm acquired by 1D CNN model showed 73.2% of accuracy rate. Conclusion(s): The results suggest that morning activity, especially vigorous activity, and exposure to any light in morning, and outside light during afternoon are important to sleep quality. The algorithm made by 1D-CNN model can predict sleep quality accurately which is comparable to the traditional logistic regression.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,NA,138,NA,Supplement 1,27,NA,J.

We aimed to develop a set of tools that utilize the vital sign streams captured by bedside monitors to quantify Cardio-Pulmonary (CP) interactions and autonomic function. Methods ECG, arterial blood pressure and respiratory-related waveforms recorded from critically-ill children were used. A set of analytical tools employing techniques from classical signal processing, nonlinear dynamical systems and Information theory were consolidated. CP interactions were evaluated by assessing properties such as phase-amplitude coupling, phase-response-curves and synchrograms. Autonomic function was explored by fractal properties, coherence, transfer-functions and entropy-based measures. Results These tools were assessed on two populations: Children extubated in the critical care unit and those who underwent cardiac arrest. Respiratory effects on blood pressure and heart rate are quantified and related to the respiratory phase. Autonomic function was assessed from the the heart rate and its interplay with blood pressure. Phenomena such as respiratory sinus arrhythmia, intermittent synchronization and baroreflex sensitivity are easily quantified. Differential effects of positive and negative pressure ventilation are explored and related to clinical status. Moreover, derangement of these interactions can be seen surrounding a cardiac arrest. Conclusions We present a toolset adapted to the population of critically-ill children allowing assessment of CP interactions and autonomic function from vital sign streams captured by bedside monitors.

A measure of open endotracheal suctioning frequency can be gained by loss of end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) recording. We aimed to identify bronchiolitic children who failed extubation by the daily frequency of gaps in ETCO2 recording relative to heart rate (HR) measurements, using high-resolution bedside monitor data. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study in a single tertiary PICU over a 2-year period. High-resolution data capture from bedside monitors (every 5 seconds) for mechanically ventilated children with bronchiolitis <2 years old was used to assess ETCO2 and HR recordings. Patients were categorised following extubation as successful or failed (including if non-invasive support was needed post-extubation). We used multi-level linear regression analysis to seek an association gaps in ETCO2 relative to HR recordings and day of admission, comparing those who succeeded and failed extubation using a likelihood ratio test. Results Data were available from 39 children, with 2948953 recorded sets of observations. Data included 20 successful extubations and 20 failed extubations (12 needing non-invasive support). The percentage of ETCO2 gaps significantly increased per day (p<0.05) in children extubated successfully, but not in those who failed. The difference in ETCO2 gap change per day according to extubation success trended towards, but did not reach significance (LR test chi 2.87, p=0.09) Conclusions Although gaps in ETCO2 measurement did not significantly predict extubation success in this cohort, this may still contribute towards multi-variable machine learning algorithms in predicting extubation success.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,NA,105-106,NA,6 Supplement 1,19,NA,Pediatr.

Previous prediction efforts used vital signs up until arrest, when clinical deterioration is clear. We aim to identify patients at risk of CA at various time points prior to arrest (PTA) to allow providers time to intervene. Methods Retrospective analysis of 210 CA patients, 488 controls admitted to a tertiary 41-bed PICU between 2011-2016. Age, weight, hourly vital signs (VS) (heart and respiratory rates, blood pressure, temperature, pulse oximetry, end-tidal CO2 when applicable), and fluid balance were collected for up to 12 hours PTA. We compared newly attempted (XGboost) classifiers to Random Forest and logistic regression. We predicted CA from 3 sequential hourly timepoints (m), ending at t= (0, 1,...,6) PTA. Age was re-matched per reclassification. Results XGboost was able to match the predictive power of previously published models that required 12+ hours of VS using fewer data points and time intervals ending hours before arrest. XGboost yielded average AUC=0.94, (minimum: 0.91; 40% crossvalidation) in all time intervals ending at t=(0,1,2,...,6) hours PTA (Figure 1). Conclusions We have shown that XGboost requires only 2 hours of data to generate models with AUC=0.94 attaining precision previously requiring 12+hours of data. Performance remains high between the earliest (6 hours PTA) and latest (at arrest) time intervals analyzed. XGboost predictors can be used to generate models that alert providers to impending CA early enough for clinical intervention.

It is a significant source of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The development of preclinical models of TBI and ability to perform neuroimaging in these models is critical in identifying the pathophysiological changes that occur after TBI. The objective of this study was to characterize a primary overpressure blast injury in rat brain using FDG PET imaging. Method(s): Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n=12) were imaged at 3-time points (prior to injury, baseline; 1-3 hours post injury, day 0; and one-week post injury, day 7). PET/CT images were acquired using an Inveon multimodality preclinical scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The rats were divided into two groups, sham (n=6) and blast (n=6). The rats were exposed to a blast using a custom-built advanced blast simulator (Ora Inc, Fredericksburg, VA). For PET/CT imaging, Anesthetized animals were injected with [18F] FDG (0.966 +/- 0.05 mCi) into the lateral tail vein. After injection, animals were returned to a separate cage (on a heating pad at 37degreeC) without food and water for conscious uptake (30 minutes). The total uptake time before PET imaging was 45 minutes (30 minutes awake and 15 minutes anesthetized). Physiologic monitoring during imaging included measurements of temperature, respiration rate, heart rate and oxygen saturation. A 30-minute static PET scan was acquired in list mode (350-650keV, 3.483 ns) with an axial field of view of 12.7 cm. A brief CT scan (3 bed in 'rat mode', 500uA, 80kVp) was acquired followed by PET scans for anatomical localization, and attenuation and scatter correction. The PET data were reconstructed as a single static frame with OSEM3D/MAP algorithm and corrected for scatter and attenuation. The CT images were reconstructed using Feldkamp algorithm, downsampled and beam hardening and HU corrections applied. The reconstructed PET/CT data were processed and analyzed using Vivoquant Software version 3.0 (inviCRO, Boston, MA). The PET data were registered to 13 regions from the rat brain atlas by way of CT using an automatic algorithm. The data analysis was performed using a semi quantitative Methods: Standardized Uptake Value (SUV - activity concentration in a specific region normalized to the total injected activity and body weight) normalized to the whole brain (SUVw) was analyzed. All statistical analyses were conducted using Graphpad Prism software version 7.01. Result(s): Volume-of-Interest analysis (Vivoquant atlas) showed statistically significant differences in regional FDG uptake. 1. Amygdala, Olfactory, and Corpus Callosum all showed higher FDG uptake in Blast group, both at day 0 and day 7 when compared to the Sham group (Two-way Repeated Measures ANOVA, Sidak's multiple comparisons test). 2. The Midbrain showed lower FDG uptake at day 0 in Blast group when compared to the Sham group (Two-way Repeated Measures ANOVA, Sidak's multiple comparisons test). Conclusion(s): The primary blast wave caused an acute increase in FDG uptake in the olfactory and amygdala, and a decrease in uptake in the midbrain. These data suggest that primary blast injury model may be useful for isolating neurological changes after blast using FDG PET.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,NA,NA,NA,Supplement 1,59,NA,J.

We have previously developed a method to extract a respiratory signal from the PET raw data based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In this work, we evaluated the performance of this method on 28 FDG oncology patient datasets. Method(s): Data were acquired in 3 different centres with external monitoring of the respiration using the RPM system. The bed position encompassing the lower lung was selected for further processing. The DD method was applied using the PET list mode data as input [1,2]. Signals were extracted using 4 variations of the method, i.e., with or without using Time of Flight (TOF) information and with or without masking [3]. In a first stage, the DD signals were compared to the RPM signal for different acquisition durations and different total number of utilised counts by selecting counts from the list mode file, with multiple time intervals used per patient. Evaluation metrics included correlation of the signal with the RPM signal (SignalCorr), and the correct identification of inspiration vs. expiration. In a second stage, the DD (using TOF and masking) and RPM respiratory signals were normalised using z-scoring and then used to gate all the available PET data using displacement gating. The gated data were then reconstructed with OSEM without attenuation correction. For each patient, a 10x10x10cm Region of Interest was identified with sufficient contrast to be able to measure foot-to-head motion via image registration. Evaluation metrics chosen were maximum detected organ displacement (MaxDisp) and organ displacement per signal displacement (RelDisp), where the latter was determined using a linear fit over all the gates. Result(s): The results show that utilising TOF data, together with the application of a cylindrical mask, improves the quality of the DD signal, the impact being more significant when using lower counts (i.e. higher level of noise) as opposed to shorter interval durations (Table I). The use of the PCA signal for gating resulted in most cases in similar results to when using the RPM signal, and for those patients where differences were found, the PCA gating produced the higher MaxDisp and higher RelDisp value (Figure I). The closer analysis of those patients showed that the RPM revealed a drift in its signal values, not present in the PCA case, that affected the gate assignment. Conclusion(s): PCA can be used to provide a reliable respiratory signal from raw PET data, with best results obtained when using TOF and masking. With the utilised displacement gating parameters, using the PCA signal for gating has proved to be equivalent or better than the external monitor at discriminating the patient's motion.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,NA,NA,NA,Supplement 1,59,NA,J.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs that are important regulators of gene expression, typically repress expression of their target mRNAs. It remains unknown whether sleep deprivation or the adverse combination of sleep deprivation and psychological stress affect miRNA responses in humans, and whether these responses predict cognitive performance during sleep deprivation. Method(s): Thirty-two healthy adults (ages 27?53; mean+/-SD, 35.1 +/- 7.1y; 14 women) participated in a five-day experiment consisting of two 8h time-in-bed (TIB) baseline nights, followed by 39h of total sleep deprivation (TSD) and two 8h-10h TIB recovery nights. A modified Trier Social Stress Test was conducted on the day after TSD to induce psychological stress. The Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT), Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), and Digit Span Task (DS), were administered throughout the experiment. Blood samples were taken at 6 time points and miRNAs from plasma were analyzed via Affymetrix microarrays. Linear mixed models with Z-score log2 fold change cutoffs of +/-1.645 and greater (FDR<0.05) and pathway analysis using the random forest method were used for statistical analysis Results: Compared to the pre-study time point, 10 miRNAs showed fold changes with TSD alone and 18 miRNAs showed fold changes with TSD and psychological stress; these miRNAs targeted 2309 and 2823 genes, respectively, with 700 overlapping targets. Notably, at pre study, 14 miRNAs predicted PVT lapses and errors during TSD, 7 miRNAs predicted DSST performance and 10 miRNAs predicted DS performance. Conclusion(s): For the first time we show that peripheral miRNAs can track responses to total sleep deprivation and its detrimental combination with psychological stress and predict individual differences in cognitive performance. As such, peripheral miRNAs are viable epigenetic biomarkers of sleep deprivation, psychological stress, and cognitive vulnerability in humans.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,NA,A5-A6,NA,Supplement 1,41,NA,Sleep,NA,"32nd Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, SLEEP 2018.

Furthermore, many obese patients are presumed to have high bone density due to the influence of high weight and may not be identified for any DXA scan.Whole body, three-dimensional optical (3DO) scanning is an automated, highly accessible technology shown to accurately predict fat and lean mass status. In this study, we investigate the ability of 3DO to predict the status of Osteopenia (OP), Obesity (OB), and Sarcopenia (S) in women. Purpose(s): To create models for predicting OB, S, and OP status, individually and in combination, in women from 3DO scans. Method(s): The Risk Factors for Breast Cancer Lymphedema Study is a recruitment of 815 women that have had breast cancer and are at risk of developing lymphedema.Each woman received spine,hip,and whole body dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans using a Hologic Horizon scanner (Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA) and one 3DO scan using a Fit3D Proscanner (Fit3D,Redwood City,CA).Subjects were classified as sarcopenic if their appendicular skeletal mass index was lower than 5.45 kg/m2,obese if their body percent fat was greater than 40% body fat (BF), and osteopenic if their hip or spine T-score was <-1.0. We noted the combinational categories of each condition for a total of 8 categories: normal metabolic status, OP, OB, S, OPOB, OP-S, OB-S, and OP-OB-S. 3DO scans were registered to a standard CAESAR template following the methods of Allen et al (1). Shape variation of 3DO scans was quantified using principal component analysis. Probabilities of OP, OB, and S were derived using logistic regression using the shape PCA descriptors.Visual PCA shape models were created for each category. Result(s): At this time, we have evaluated 85 women with mixed menopausal status, ethnicity, age = 60.6 +/- 8.8 years, and BMI = 25.7 +/- 4.9 kg/m2.The first 9 PCA components described 95% of the total shape variance. Logistic regression models combining these PCA modes for predicting OP,OB,and S status had AUROC values 0.78, 0.90, and 0.89 respectively. The model was able to distinguish sarcopenic obesity vs. non-sarcopenic obesity with an AUROC of 0.93.Visual PCA shape models are shown in Fig.1 with the number of women in each category.At 80% sensitivity, specificities of classifying OP, OB, S, and OB-S were 60%, 86%, 81%, and 88% respectively. Conclusion(s): 3DO whole body imaging shows promise as a fast, inexpensive and automated screening technology for identifying women with OB, S, and OB-S. However, classification of OP status was weak.Women with osteopenia do not look markedly different than women with normal bone status.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,NA,33-34,NA,1,21,NA,J.

APPROACH: A bed equipped with four load cell sensors and synchronized video was used to assess the load cell response of 54 healthy individuals in prescribed positions and as they moved between positions. Stationary positions were characterized by the signals from the four load cells and the coordinates of the center of mass (CoM). Movements were characterized by the changes in load cell signals, four parameters associated with the trajectory of the CoM between the initial and final position (Euclidean distance, length of the trajectory, and the x- and y- variances), and the initial position's CoM coordinates. Classification and decision tree models were used to assess the ability of these parameters to identify specific positions or movements. MAIN RESULTS: Six positions were classified with an accuracy of 74.9% and six movements were classified with an accuracy of 79.7%.

Recently developed acoustic techniques based on the evaluation of the forced expiratory noise time (FETa) were hypothesized to be a promising tool for this aim. The aim of the protocol is to study the effect of two different modalities of bed rest space simulations (microgravity and lunar gravity) on FETa and spirometric indices. The FETa in the frequency band of 200-2000 Hz, recorded above human trachea, was evaluated. The 21st-day exposure to 6 degree head-down tilt (HDT) bed rest, simulating microgravity, and 9.6 degree head-up tilt (HUT) bed rest with head-zero tilt (HZT) rest intervals (HUT + HZT), simulating lunar gravity, in statistically identical subgroups of five and six healthy male volunteers, was studied. In the course of HDT bed rest, a significant elongation of FETa was found in relation to background measurements in ""sitting"" position (p = 0.016). The effect corresponded to a significant decrease of basic spirometric indices (p < 0.02). Moreover, FETa provided reliable discrimination of HDT and HUT + HZT bed rest tests (p = 0.018), while spirometric indices did not (p > 0.05). Based on previously found correlations (Korenbaum and Pochekutova, 2008; Malaeva et al., 2017), a FETa elongation in response to HDT bed rest was attributed to an increase of aerodynamic resistance of the respiratory tract. The technique seems promising to monitor human pulmonary ventilation dynamics in long-term space missions; however, new studies are welcome to verify it in real spaceflight.Copyright © 2018 Malaeva, Korenbaum, Pochekutova, Kostiv, Shin, Katuntsev and Baranov.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,NA,1255,NA,OCT,9,NA,Front.

To properly analyze such data and extract clinical knowledge, noise componentsmust be removed or alleviated. In this paper a pre-processing and subsequent sleep staging pipeline for the sleep analysis of electroencephalographic signals is described. Two novel methods of functional connectivity estimation (Synchronization Likelihood/SL and Relative Wavelet Entropy/RWE) are comparatively investigated for automatic sleep staging through manually pre-processed electroencephalographic recordings. A multi-step process that renders signals suitable for further analysis is initially described. Then, two methods that rely on extracting synchronization features from electroencephalographic recordings to achieve computerized sleep staging are proposed, based on bivariate features which provide a functional overview of the brain network, contrary to most proposed methods that rely on extracting univariate time and frequency features. Annotation of sleep epochs is achieved through the presented feature extraction methods by training classifiers, which are in turn able to accurately classify new epochs. Analysis of data from sleep experiments on a randomized, controlled bed-rest study, which was organized by the European Space Agency and was conducted in the ""ENVIHAB"" facility of the Institute of Aerospace Medicine at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Cologne, Germany attains high accuracy rates, over 90% based on ground truth that resulted from manual sleep staging by two experienced sleep experts. Therefore, it can be concluded that the above feature extraction methods are suitable for semi-automatic sleep staging.Copyright © 2018 Chriskos, Frantzidis, Gkivogkli, Bamidis and Kourtidou-Papadeli.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,2022-08-24T07:29:32Z,NA,110,NA,"(Chriskos, Frantzidis, Gkivogkli, Bamidis) Laboratory of Medical Physics, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece",12,NA,Front.

The aim of the study was to investigate the perceived duration and quality of patient sleep and identify any environmental factors associated with patient-reported poor sleep in hospital. METHOD(S): A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 15 clinical units within a 672-bed tertiary-referral hospital in Australia. Semi-structured interviews to determine perceptions of sleep quantity and quality and factors that disturb nocturnal sleep were conducted with patients and nursing staff. Environmental noise, light and temperature were monitored overnight, with concurrent logging of noise sources by observers. RESULT(S): Patients reported a mean reduction in hospital sleep duration, compared to home, of 1.8 h (5.3 vs. 7.1 h; p<0.001). The proportions of patients reporting their sleep quality to be poor/very poor, fair and of good quality were 41.6, 34.2 and 24.2% respectively. Patients reported poorer sleep quality than nurses (p<0.05). Patients, nurses and observers all reported the main factors associated with poor sleep as clinical care interventions (34.3%) and environmental noise (32.1%).

Implementation of new video monitoring technology can help reduce fall rates in inpatient rehabilitation settings., PURPOSE: Falls are a major safety issue in rehabilitation settings. Patients receive mixed messages-try to be as independent as possible, but don't do anything in your room without calling for assistance. Despite the use of multiple falls interventions at this facility, the fall rate remained high. To impact this rate, the facility implemented a video monitoring system. This system allows for patients at risk for falling to be monitored from a remote location. The monitor technician is able to speak to the patient directly and/or contact staff members to respond to the room, preventing a fall., DESIGN: Sequential cohort design., METHOD: Fifteen video monitoring units were installed on high-risk units in a 115-bed inpatient rehabilitation facility. Total falls and falls rates were tracked and reported pre- and postimplementation., FINDINGS: Over a 21-month period prior to implementing the video monitoring system, the average hospital-wide rate of falls was 6.34 per 1,000 patient-days (SD = 1.7488). After a year of usage, that average has decreased to 5.099 falls per 1,000 patient-days (SD = 1.524). The reduction in falls was statistically significant. In addition, there have been significant cost savings by reducing sitter usage., CONCLUSIONS: Video monitoring can improve patient safety by decreasing falls; decreasing sitter usage and cost; and improving patient, family, and staff satisfaction.",2018,2022-08-24T07:29:33Z,2022-08-24T07:29:33Z,NA,111-115,NA,2,43,NA,Rehabil Nurs,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed19&NEWS=N&AN=622785110,physiologic monitoring; patient safety; human; procedures; cohort analysis; statistics and numerical data; New York; prevention and control; falling; *standards; computer terminal; rehabilitation nursing,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Several attempts at quantifying seizure movements have been performed in the past using 2D marker-based approaches, which have several drawbacks for the clinical routine (e.g. occlusions, lack of precision, and discomfort for the patient). These drawbacks are overcome with a 3D markerless approach. Recently, we published the development of a single-bed 3Dvideo-EEG system using a single RGB-D camera (Kinect v1). In this contribution, we describe how we expanded the previous single-bed system to a multi-bed departmental one that has been managing 6.61 Terabytes per day since March 2016. Our unique dataset collected so far includes 2.13 Terabytes of multimedia data, corresponding to 278 3Dvideo-EEG seizures from 111 patients.

This study was conducted in a 1000-bed teaching hospital in Eastern China where 250 to 350 cardiac surgeries are performed each year., METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study among consecutive patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery between January and December 2015. The ANN model was built based on possible SRPI risk factors. The model performance was tested by a receiver operating characteristic curve and the C-index. A C-index from 0.5 to 0.7 is classified as having low accuracy, 0.7 to 0.9 as having moderate accuracy, and 0.9 to 1.0 as having high accuracy. We also compared the actual SRPI incidences based on the ANN stratification., RESULTS: Thirty-seven of 147 patients developed SRPIs, yielding an incidence rate of 24.8% (95% CI, 18.1-32.6). The C-index was 0.815, which showed the ANN model had a moderate prediction value for SRPI. According to the ANN model, the SRPI predicting incidence ranged from 6.4% to 67.7%. Surgery-related pressure injury incidences were significantly different among 3 risk groups stratified by the ANN (P < .05)., CONCLUSION: We established an ANN model that provides moderate prediction of SRPI in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgical procedures.

The appeal of rule extraction techniques stems from their ability to handle intricate problems yet produce models based on rules that can be comprehended by humans, and are therefore more transparent. Human comprehension is a factor that may improve adoption and use of data-driven decision support systems clinically via face validity. In this work, we explore whether we can reliably and informatively forecast cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) in step-down unit (SDU) patients utilizing data from continuous monitoring of physiologic vital sign (VS) measurements. We use a temporal association rule extraction technique in conjunction with a rule fusion protocol to learn how to forecast CRI in continuously monitored patients. We detail our approach and present and discuss encouraging empirical results obtained using continuous multivariate VS data from the bedside monitors of 297 SDU patients spanning 29 346 hours (3.35 patient-years) of observation. We present example rules that have been learned from data to illustrate potential benefits of comprehensibility of the extracted models, and we analyze the empirical utility of each VS as a potential leading indicator of an impending CRI event.Copyright © The Author 2016.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:33Z,2022-08-24T07:29:33Z,NA,47-53,NA,1,24,NA,J.

Early detection and access to the history of a fall is crucial for efficient care and secondary prevention in cognitively impaired individuals. However, most falls remain unwitnessed events. Furthermore, understanding why and how a fall occurred is a challenge. Video capture and secure transmission of real-world falls thus stands as a promising assistive tool., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze how continuous video monitoring and review of falls of individuals with dementia can support better quality of care., METHODS: A pilot observational study (July-September 2016) was carried out in a Californian memory care facility. Falls were video-captured (24x7), thanks to 43 wall-mounted cameras (deployed in all common areas and in 10 out of 40 private bedrooms of consenting residents and families). Video review was provided to facility staff, thanks to a customized mobile device app. The outcome measures were the count of residents' falls happening in the video-covered areas, the acceptability of video recording, the analysis of video review, and video replay possibilities for care practice., RESULTS: Over 3 months, 16 falls were video-captured. A drop in fall rate was observed in the last month of the study. Acceptability was good. Video review enabled screening for the severity of falls and fall-related injuries. Video replay enabled identifying cognitive-behavioral deficiencies and environmental circumstances contributing to the fall. This allowed for secondary prevention in high-risk multi-faller individuals and for updated facility care policies regarding a safer living environment for all residents., CONCLUSIONS: Video monitoring offers high potential to support conventional care in memory care facilities.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:33Z,2022-08-24T07:29:33Z,NA,e339,NA,10,19,NA,J.

Recently, we have developed a frailty meter (FM) using two wearable sensors, which allows capturing key frailty phenotypes (weakness, slowness, and exhaustion), by testing 20-s rapid elbow flexion-extension test. Objective(s): In this study, we proposed an enhanced automated algorithm to identify frailty using a single wrist-worn sensor. Method(s): The data collected from 100 geriatric inpatients (age: 78.9 +/- 9.1 years, 49% frail) were reanalyzed to validate the new algorithm. The frailty status of the participants was determined using a validated modified frailty index. Different FM phenotypes (31 features) including velocity of elbow rotation, decline in velocity of elbow rotation over 20 s, range of motion, etc. were extracted. A regression model, bootstrap with 2,000 iterations, and recursive feature elimination technique were used for optimizing the FM parameters and identifying frailty using a single wrist-worn sensor. Result(s): A strong agreement was observed between two-sensor and wrist-worn sensor configuration (r = 0.87, p < 0.001). Results suggest that the wrist-worn FM with no demographic information still yields a high accuracy of 80.0% (95% CI: 79.7-80.3%) and an area under the curve of 87.7% (95% CI: 87.4-87.9%) to identify frailty status. Results are comparable with two-sensor configuration, where the observed accuracy and area under the curve were 80.6% (95% CI: 80.4-80.9%) and 87.4% (95% CI: 87.1-87.6%), respectively. Conclusion(s): The simplicity of FM may open new avenues to integrate wearable technology and mobile health to capture frailty status in a busy hospital setting. Furthermore, the reduction of needed sensors to a single wrist-worn sensor allows deployment of the proposed algorithm in the form of a smartwatch application. From the application standpoint, the proposed FM is superior to traditional physical frailty-screening tools in which the walking test is a key frailty phenotype, and thus they cannot be used for bedbound patients or in busy clinics where administration of gait test as a part of routine assessment is impractical.Copyright © 2017 S.

The ICU's high-intensity environment requires staff's vigilant attention, and distraction from false and non-actionable alarms pulls staff away from important tasks, creates dissatisfaction, and is a potential patient safety risk if alarms are missed or ignored. This project was intended to improve patient safety by optimizing alarm systems in a cardiovascular surgical intensive care unit (CVSICU). Specific aims were to examine nurses' attitudes toward clinical alarm signals, assess nurses' ability to discriminate audible alarm signals, and implement a bundled set of best practices for monitor alarm reduction without undermining patient safety. METHOD(S): CVSICU nurses completed an alarm perception survey and participated in alarm discriminability testing. Nurse survey data and baseline monitor alarm data were used to select targeted alarm reduction interventions, which were progressively phased in. Monitor alarm data and cardiorespiratory event data were trended over one year. RESULT(S): Five of the most frequent CVSICU monitor alarm types-pulse oximetry, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse oximetry sensor, and ventricular tachycardia>2-were targeted. After implementation, there was a 61% reduction in average alarms per monitored bed and a downward trend in cardiorespiratory events. CONCLUSION(S): To reduce alarm fatigue it is important to decrease alarm burden through targeted interventions. Methods to reduce non-actionable alarms include adding short delays to allow alarm self-correction, adjusting default alarm threshold limits, providing alarm notification through a secondary device, and teaching staff to optimize alarm settings for individual patients.Copyright © 2016 The Joint Commission.

Then, CPC analysis was conducted using extracted respiratory signals and NN interval series, and six CPC parameters were extracted (VLFC, LFC, HFC, e-LFC, e-LFCNB and e-LFCBB). To evaluate the proposed method, two statistical analyses were conducted between the CPC parameters extracted by the electrocardiogram-based conventional method and the air mattress-based proposed method for five patients with obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea (OSAH). Wilcoxon's signed rank test on the CPC parameters of the two methods indicated no significant differences (p > 0.05) and Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed high positive correlations (r >= 0.7, p < 0.05) between the two methods. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential for performing CPC analysis using air mattress-based system.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:33Z,2022-08-24T07:29:33Z,NA,177,NA,11,41,NA,J.

The rate and depth of compressions and oxygen consumption during ECC were measured. Results Mean compression rate recorded was above 100/min in both positions throughout ECC. Mean compression depth for male participants was more than 38 mm for 5 min in the K-position but only 3 min in the S-position. Female participants achieved this compression depth for less than 90 s in the K-position but not at all in the S-position. Conclusion Irrespective of sex, the K-position appears to facilitate effective ECC. The relationship between aerobic fitness of female nurses and their ability to perform effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Currently, its assessment relies on subjective clinical decisions. In this study, we explore the variability of such clinical assessments, and present an easy-to-use device composed of cameras and video processing algorithms that could help the clinician to improve the detection of visual pursuit in a clinical context. Visual pursuit was assessed by an experienced research neuropsychologist on 31 patients with DOC and on 23 healthy subjects, while the device was used to simultaneously record videos of both one eye and the mirror. These videos were then scored by three researchers: the experienced research neuropsychologist who did the clinical assessment, another experienced research neuropsychologist, and a neurologist. For each video, a consensus was decided between the three persons, and used as the gold standard of the presence or absence of visual pursuit. Almost 10% of the patients were misclassified at the bedside according to their consensus. An automatic classifier analyzed eye and mirror trajectories, and was able to identify patients and healthy subjects with visual pursuit, in total agreement with the consensus on video. In conclusion, our device can be used easily in patients with DOC while respecting the current guidelines of visual pursuit assessment. Our results suggest that our material and our classification method can identify patients with visual pursuit, as well as the three researchers based on video recordings can.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:33Z,2022-08-24T07:29:33Z,NA,928-937,NA,5,264,NA,J.

Currently, healthcare providers are coping with ever-growing healthcare challenges including an ageing population, chronic diseases, the cost of hospitalization, and the risk of medical errors. WPM systems are a potential solution for addressing some of these challenges by enabling advanced sensors, wearable technology, and secure and effective communication platforms between the clinicians and patients. A total of 791 articles were screened and 20 were selected for this review. The most common publication venue was conference proceedings (13, 54%). This review only considered recent studies published between 2015 and 2017. The identified studies involved chronic conditions (6, 30%), rehabilitation (7, 35%), cardiovascular diseases (4, 20%), falls (2, 10%) and mental health (1, 5%). Most studies focussed on the system aspects of WPM solutions including advanced sensors, wireless data collection, communication platform and clinical usability based on a specific area or disease. The current studies are progressing with localized sensor-software integration to solve a specific use-case/health area using non-scalable and 'silo' solutions. There is further work required regarding interoperability and clinical acceptance challenges. The advancement of wearable technology and possibilities of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in healthcare is a concept that has been investigated by many studies.

Machine learning techniques have the potential to move from group-level statistical results to personalized predictions in a clinical setting. They have been applied for the purpose of (1) detecting changes in brain activation during functional tasks, equivalent to a behavioral command-following test and (2) estimating signs of consciousness by analyzing measurement data obtained from multiple subjects in resting state. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on both approaches and discuss the translation of present findings to clinical practice. We found that most studies struggle with the difficulty of establishing a reliable behavioral assessment and fluctuations in the patient's levels of arousal. Both these factors affect the training and validation of machine learning methods to a considerable degree. In studies involving more than 50 patients, small to moderate evidence was found for the presence of signs of consciousness or good outcome, where one study even showed strong evidence for good outcome.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,NA,288-303,NA,"(Noirhomme, Brecheisen) Brain Innovation BV, Maastricht, Netherlands",145,NA,NeuroImage,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States Publisher: Academic Press Inc.

We used an extended Kalman filter to develop a computationally efficient algorithm that continually adapts the parameters of the recently developed Unified Model of Performance (UMP) to an individual. The algorithm accomplishes this in real time as new performance data for the individual become available. We assessed the algorithm's performance by simulating real-time model individualization for 18 subjects subjected to 64 h of total sleep deprivation (TSD) and 7 days of chronic sleep restriction (CSR) with 3 h of time in bed per night, using psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) data collected every 2 h during wakefulness. This UMP individualization process produced parameter estimates that progressively approached the solution produced by a post-hoc fitting of model parameters using all data. The minimum number of PVT measurements needed to individualize the model parameters depended upon the type of sleep-loss challenge, with ~30 required for TSD and ~70 for CSR. However, model individualization depended upon the overall duration of data collection, yielding increasingly accurate model parameters with greater number of days. Interestingly, reducing the PVT sampling frequency by a factor of two did not notably hamper model individualization. The proposed algorithm facilitates real-time learning of an individual's trait-like responses to sleep loss and enables the development of individualized performance prediction models for use in a mobile computing platform.Copyright © 2017 European Sleep Research Society",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,NA,820-831,NA,6,26,NA,J.

To evaluate the dynamics of the parameters of autonomic balance and electrical instability of the myocardium depending on the effectiveness of the restoration of coronary blood flow in pharmacoinvasive revascularization in patients with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction. Material and methods. The study included 91 patients who underwent effective thrombolytic therapy (TLT) according to the ECG criteria, followed by (3-24 hour later) coronary angiography with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Before and after PCI the telemetric ECG recording was conducted. The dynamics of the temporal and spectral characteristics of heart rate variability (HRV), presence of ventricular late potentials (VLP) and abnormal heart rate turbulence (HRT) were evaluated. Results. The episodes of ST-segment re-elevation by 1 mm or more, lasting at least 1 min, and the dynamics of some HRV indices indicated the development of rethrombosis after TLT. The increase in the mean square deviation of normal intervals to 82.5 (64.5; 94) ms, the average value of the standard deviations of normal intervals calculated over 5-minute intervals throughout the entire recording to 37.5 (31.5; 47.5) ms, the total power of the spectrum and the power of high frequency waves, as well as the decrease in the power of ultra-low frequency waves were found after PCI in the group with a rethrombosis of the infarct-related coronary artery. The analysis of VLP in this group showed an increase in duration of the filtered QRS complex after TLT (to 128.7+/-34.5 ms), and the root mean square value of the last 40 ms of the QRS complex after PCI (to 49+/-50.3 muV). Pathological deviations of the HRT parameters (especially the onset of turbulence) independently on the absolute values were registered more often in patients with rethrombosis, and abnormal values of both HRT parameters were found only in patients with episodes of unstable coronary blood flow. Conclusion. The results are the indirect evidences of disruption of autonomic regulation of cardiac activity and increased arrhythmic readiness of myocardium in developing rethrombosis of coronary artery. The pronounced reperfusion injury of the myocardium evidently plays an important role in this process and is associated with embolization of the vessels of the microcirculatory bed, release of free radicals and alteration of cardiomyocytes, especially due to prolonged ischemia.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,NA,787-793,NA,6,13,NA,Ration.

In this pilot study, we investigate a movement monitoring sensor system for identifying bed and chair exits using a wireless wearable sensor worn by hospitalized older patients. We developed a movement monitoring sensor system that recognizes bed and chair exits. The system consists of a machine learning based activity classifier and a bed and chair exit recognition process based on an activity score function. Twenty-six patients, aged 71 to 93 years old, hospitalized in the Geriatric Evaluation and Management Unit participated in the supervised trials. They wore over their attire a battery-less, lightweight and wireless sensor and performed scripted activities such as getting off the bed and chair. We investigated the system performance in recognizing bed and chair exits in hospital rooms where RFID antennas and readers were in place. The system's acceptability was measured using two surveys with 0-10 likert scales. The first survey measured the change in user perception of the system before and after a trial; the second survey, conducted only at the end of each trial, measured user acceptance of the system based on a multifactor sensor acceptance model. The performance of the system indicated an overall recall of 81.4%, precision of 66.8% and F-score of 72.4% for joint bed and chair exit recognition. Patients demonstrated improved perception of the system after use with overall score change from 7.8 to 9.0 and high acceptance of the system with score 6.7 for all acceptance factors. The present pilot study suggests the use of wireless wearable sensors is feasible for detecting bed and chair exits in a hospital environment.Copyright © 2017 Shinmoto Torres et al.

Central modulatory effects play a role in plastic changes, and are of uttermost importance in rehabilitation. This has extensively been studied for upper limb, but less is known for lower limb. The aim of this study is to investigate the topographical distribution of event-related desynchronization/synchronization(ERD/ERS) and task-relatedcoherence during a robot-assisted and a motor imagery task of lower limb in healthy subjects to inform rehabilitation paradigms. 32-channels electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded in twenty-one healthy right footed and handed subjects during a robot-assisted single-joint cyclic right ankle movement performed by the BTS ANYMOV robotic hospital bed. Data were acquired with a block protocol for passive and imagined movement at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. ERD/ERS and task related coherence were calculated in alpha1 (8-10 Hz), alpha2 (10.5-12.5 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) frequency ranges. During passive movement, alpha2 rhythm desynchronized overC3 and ipsilateral frontal areas (F4, FC2, FC6); betaERD was detected over the bilateral motor areas (Cz, C3, C4). During motor imagery, a significant desynchronization was evident for alpha1 over contralateral sensorimotor cortex (C3), for alpha2 over bilateral motor areas (C3 and C4), and for beta over central scalp areas. Task-related coherence decreased during passive movement in alpha2 band between contralateral central area (C3, CP5, CP1, P3) and ipsilateral frontal area (F8, FC6, T8); beta band coherence decreased between C3-C4 electrodes, and increased between C3-Cz. These data contribute to the understanding of oscillatory activity and functional neuronal interactions during lower limb robot-assisted motor performance. The final output of this line of research is to inform the design and development of neurorehabilitation protocols.Copyright © 2001-2011 IEEE.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,NA,1633-1640,NA,9,25,NA,IEEE Trans.

Sleep apnea is the most common type of breathing-related sleep disorder. It manifests in a variety of behaviours from teeth grinding to night terrors as involuntary nighttime events. The most common sleep disorders are narcolepsy, hypersomnia, sleep talking, sleep walking, and bedwetting. Sleep apnea (somnipathy) is a serious sleep disorder that pauses breathing while sleeping. Breathing pauses occur 30 times or more during sleep and it lasts for few seconds to minutes, when normal breathing starts after this pause. Untreated sleep apnea patients stop breathing, which happens up to hundreds of times during sleep that ultimately results in atrial fibrillation, cardiac arousal, stroke, brain tumor and other vascular diseases at the age of 65 that causes death. Smokers are at a greater threat for sleep apnea. Several studies have suggested that a person who smokes more than two packs a day has 40 times the risk of sleep apnea then nonsmokers. This review includes the discussion about detection of sleep apnea from heart rate and respiratory events. The published literature of sleep apnea and methods of treatment are also discussed.Copyright © 2017, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

This study aims at automatically detecting SWSfrom nocturnal sleep using cardiorespiratory signals that can be acquired with unobtrusive sensors in a home-based scenario. From the signals, time-dependent features are extracted for continuous 30-s epochs. To reduce the measuring noise, body motion artifacts, and/or within-subject variability in physiology conveyed by the features, and thus, enhance the detection performance, we propose to smooth the features over each night using a spline fitting method. In addition, it was found that the changes in cardiorespiratory activity precede the transitions between SWS and the other sleep stages (non-SWS). To this matter, a novel scheme is proposed that performs the SWS detection for each epoch using the feature values prior to that epoch. Experiments were conducted with a large dataset of 325 overnight polysomnography (PSG) recordings using a linear discriminant classifier and tenfold cross validation. Features were selected with a correlation-based method. Results show that the performance in classifying SWS and non-SWS can be significantly improved when smoothing the features and using the preceding feature values of 5- min earlier. We achieved a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.57 (at an accuracy of 88.8%) using only six selected features for 257 recordings with aminimum of 30-min overnight SWS that were considered representative of their habitual sleeping pattern at home. These features included the standard deviation, low-frequency spectral power, and detrended fluctuation of heartbeat intervals as well as the variations of respiratory frequency and upper and lower respiratory envelopes. A marked drop in Kappa to 0.21 was observed for the other nights with SWS time of less than 30 min, which were found to more likely occur in elderly. This will be the future challenge in cardiorespiratory-based SWS detection.Copyright © 2015 IEEE.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,NA,123-133,NA,1,21,NA,IEEE J.

While the gold standard for sleep assessment is polysomnography (PSG), the increasing availability of wearable sensor technology offers more practical ways of collecting ""digital biomarkers"" to identify risk patterns and behaviors in clinical trials and daily life. Correct interpretation of the actigraphy data is essential including clinical contextualization, for example taking into account age and neurodegenerative disorders. Method(s): Overnight PSG with simultaneous 3-axis accelerometry was undertaken on 22 elderly subjects from a community study in the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Montpellier (age: 85.7+/-3.7, 15 female, 7 male). Subjects were followed with accelerometry for an additional 13 days at home. ""Deep Learning"" techniques were used to build a convolutional neural network to predict sleep / wake status from accelerometry. Accuracy for correct sleep / wake classification, as well as an overall sleep efficiency measurement (time asleep / time in bed), were compared between the developed algorithm (referred to as DLS) and a standard sleep algorithm (ESS) that is provided with the Axivitydevice employed in the study and that has been shown to outperform count-based scoring algorithms employed in other current devices (Borazio 2014, Int. Conf. Health Inf.). Result(s): Comparing ESS and DLS, Figure 1 shows sensitivity and specificity for detecting sleep and Figure 2 shows estimated sleep efficiency as compared to PSG. DLS shows improved accuracy in classifying sleep / awake, most dramatically witnessed in a significant reduction of false positive prediction of sleep. This leads to a substantially reduced error between predicted and true sleep efficiency (as measured through PSG). Conclusion(s): The presented results show the potential of Deep Learning techniques to identify ""digital biomarkers"" from wearable sensor data. The presented algorithm, outperformed traditional analysis techniques currently employed in commercially available devices. In elderly subjects periods of quiet (not-moving) wakefulness are common during the night; the standard actigraphy algorithms may be incorrectly interpreting these periods as sleep. Current work involves actigraphy- based sleep assessment of the longitudinal home data to identify any differences in sleep behavior in the lab and at home (Figure Presented).",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,NA,P1012,NA,7,13,NA,Alzheimer's Dementia,NA,"Alzheimer's Association International Conference, AAIC 2017.

Introduction With the advancement of iMEMS inertial sensor based devices combined with machine learning techniques, algorithm development for human behavioral measurement using body worn sensors has soared in recent years. A drawback with algorithms that are produced purely using machine learning techniques however, is that potentially confounding activities could produce unrealistic results during the classification of postural transitions. This study thus reports on the typical temporal statistics associated with postural transitions that were re-corded from older adults during both a semi-structured and a free-living protocol recorded using video technology (> 25 fps). Previously Reyes-Ortiz et al. have proposed ranges for postural-transition duration as part of an activity classification system, however a smaller data-set of activities was used to compile their statistics [1]. 2. Research question What are the typical temporal ranges of postural-transition duration performed by older adults that can be expected in every day life situations? 3. Methods A total of 20 older adult participants were recruited from the Trondheim area in Norway. The subjects were recorded performing a semi-structured protocol in the Laboratory environment recorded using wall-mounted video cameras and a free-living protocol in their own home environment recorded using a body-worn camera. These subjects ranged in age from 68-90 years (76.4 +/- 5.6 years), body mass from 56 to 93 kg (73.7+/-11.4 kg), and height from 1.56 to 1.81 m (1.67 +/- 0.072 m). Subjects performed a series of standing, sitting at a table, sitting, on an soft arm-chair, sitting on a chair, lying on a bed, walking at various speeds, shuffling (short stepping movements), object-picking from the floor, leaning while standing and while sitting, kneeling down and transitions between static postures [2]. 4. Results Table 1 presents the ranges of transition durations for recorded during 43.92 h of physical activity data which was manually annotated to 25 fps. The transition ranges for standing, sitting, lying and walking are presented. The highest mean transition duration is from lying to standing (4.22 s). To cover 97.7% of activity durations (3 standard deviations) an upper limit of 4.13 s + (3*1.56 s) = 8.81 s can be considered. [Table Presented] 5.

Although sleep patterns are ofen altered in individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions, sleep-related research in individuals with CP are limited. Meanwhile, children with CP are at increased risk of sleep disturbances for their motor involvement, as well as for a high association with different comorbidities. In turn, disturbed sleep, even in the typically developing children, may be associated with behavioural problems and emotional instability. Te aim of this study was to evaluate sleep disturbances in pre-school children with bilateral CP and their associations with behavioural problems. Method(s): Te study was performed in St. Petersburg in 2016 and comprised 20 children with diagnosed bilateral CP aged fve years (10 boys, 10 girls) who attended special educational centre. Te control group was made up of 80 clinically healthy typically developing children matched to cases for age, sex and geographical distribution as close as possible. Te mothers were requested to fll in the Child Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ) aimed to measure certain sleep troubles in children. Te teachers were approached with the Achenbach Caregiver-Teacher Report Form for Ages 1.5-5 (C-TRF) aimed to fnd major emotional and behavioural disturbances. Result(s): Children with CP had signifcantly higher scores (more problems) on reported sleep onset delay, sleep duration and daytime sleepiness scores. Tey also scored higher on all DSM-oriented behaviour problem scales. Te diagnosis of CP as well as sleep disturbances were signifcant predictors of certain behavioural deviations, including anxiety, pervasive developmental and oppositional defant problems. Explanatory model based on the data mining procedure was constructed. Te frst predictor of behavioural problems in all children was the sleep duration score. When sleep duration was less impaired, the diagnosis CP came to the force and for those children with CP, bedtime resistance score was the next important predictor of behavioural problems. If bedtime resistance was not a major problem, then daytime sleepiness turned out to be another predictor of behavioural problems in CP children. Conclusion(s): Sleep disturbances in children with CP may be associated with behavioural problems.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,NA,S107,NA,2 Supplement 1,21,NA,Somnologie,NA,25.

Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive imaging technique that can be used to monitor regional lung ventilation (V) of mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units (ICU) at bedside (1, 2). In order to achieve an improved adjustment of ventilation therapy, additional measures of regional lung perfusion (Q) and regional lung ventilation to perfusion ratio (V/ Q) would be highly beneficial. OBJECTIVES. To develop an approach to extract functional images of V, Q and V/Q from EIT measurements and validate the method in a porcine animal trial. METHODS. After admission of the local ethics committee (Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden) a healthy pig was anesthetized and mechanically ventilated in supine position (3). Seven injections of a conductive contrast agent (NaCl 10%, 10 ml) into a central venous catheter were performed under temporary apnea at different PEEP levels (0 to 20 cmH2O). During the injections, EIT measurements (EEK 2, Draeger Medical GmbH, Luebeck, Germany) were acquired at a frame rate of 40 Hz. EIT images of conductivity change were reconstructed from the measurements based on a cylindrical finite element model (FEM). Functional images of V were obtained by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A gamma-variate model (4) was combined with a semi-negative matrix factorization to extract functional images of Q from the EIT images. RESULTS. Functional images of V (see Fig. 115, line 1) and Q (line 2) at different PEEP levels were obtained. A regional V/Q ratio (line 3) and histograms of distribution (line 4) were calculated from the images. At PEEP 0 cmH2O an inhomogeneous V/Q distribution is observed. Modification of PEEP from 0 to 20 cmH2O yields a more homogeneous V/Q which might indicate reduction in both dead space ventilation and shunt perfusion. Gradually stepping down to PEEP 0 cmH2O results in a more inhomogeneous V/Q as observed before. CONCLUSIONS. The presented approach allows for reliable extraction of regional lung perfusion (Q) from EIT images. It was possible to trace changes of regional V/Q after modification of PEEP in a porcine animal trial. The described approach might thus be a step into the direction of providing measures for improved adjustment of ventilation therapy.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,NA,NA,NA,2 Supplement 1,5,NA,Intensive Care Med.

Different amounts of total sleep deprivation reduced the activity of the resting-state default mode network (DMN). Others showed strengthening of the activity of interhemispheric connections as a putative compensatory mechanism. The objective of the current study was to investigate if chronic sleep restriction triggers comparable changes. In an ongoing study we acquired resting-state MR data from 14 healthy volunteers (final study size: 36 volunteers) on three consecutive days under different states of sleep deprivation. The experimental group (n=9) underwent chronic sleep restriction for 5 nights with 5 h time in bed (TIB) (control group: 8 h, n=5) and were scanned on the last day of restriction. Both groups then had one recovery night with 8 h TIB followed by a night of acute sleep deprivation (0 h TIB) after each of which they were scanned again. The resting-state patterns of brain activity were analyzed by an independent component analysis and subsequent dual regression comparing to an out-of-sample template of identified network components with FSL (FMRIB Software Library). The preliminary dataset showed a significant increase of activity (p<0.05) in the lateral visual area network in the experimental group on the last day of sleep restriction compared to the rested controls. Activity in this network increased (p<0.05) within the experimental group between the recovery day and the day of acute sleep deprivation. This study layout allows both the investigation of chronic sleep restriction and comparison of acute sleep deprivation following different sleep histories. The observed increase in activity in the resting-state might indicate that the preceding sleep restriction primes the brain for following acute sleep loss by increasing compensatory mechanisms.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,NA,255,NA,1 Supplement 1,37,NA,J.

(Newth 2012) Qualitative asthma severity scores (e.g. pediatric asthma score (PAS)), are subjective and while validated in less severe settings, are unreliable in the PICU. Integrated physiologic data captured from patient monitors can be analyzed in real time with machine learning algorithms to track deterioration, recovery, and treatment patterns for acute severe asthma. We designed this study to compare machine learning algorithms using continuous data with staff generated qualitative PAS scores. Method(s): We retrospectively studied 3 pediatric PICU patients admitted for acute severe asthma. Vital sign data captured (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation) from bedside Phillips monitors using Bedmaster software consisted of continuous wave form and discrete elements. Corresponding clinical data extracted from the electronic medical record included the PAS, respiratory medications, oxygen use, and non-invasive ventilation support. Regression analysis was conducted using a Seguno Fuzzy model trained by an Artificial Neural Network. Our model was initialized using Fuzzy C-means clustering which allows assignment of each data point to multiple groups governed by membership functions. To refine the model, an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference (ANFIS) system was used with input training data. Errors between ANFIS predictions and PAS references are back-propagated to modify network parameters. Each iteration of this process is known as an epoch. To remove artifacts in the testing dataset, we average 30 seconds of consecutive data samples to smooth out variations. We allocated 50% of our data set for training and the rest for testing. Each data sample is a five-dimensional vector corresponding to the Sp02, Fi02, Heart Rate, Pulse and Respiratory Rate respectively. Result(s): The median staff assigned PAS was 6 (range 5-11). Per logistic regression analysis, the main variables for PAS were FiO2 and SPO2. The algorithm cumulative distribution function (CDF) using 24,945 training samples predicted the staff assigned PAS 90% of the time within a range of 0.6 to 1.0. Respiratory rate variability resulted in occasional extreme values with the algorithm. Conclusion(s): Our data suggests application of machine learning to existing vital sign monitoring data is feasible. Using only 3 patients, the algorithm reliably predicted patient severity within 1 point of the clinically reported PAS score. This type of algorithm, once validated, can provide decision support tools to improve quality outcomes in pediatric patients treated in the PICU.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,2022-08-24T07:29:34Z,NA,NA,NA,"(Messinger, Deterding) University of Colorado, Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, CO, United States",195,NA,Am.

To our knowledge, there is currently no suitable bedside monitor for brain activity which can be used for assessment, monitoring and management of DOC patients. Unfortunately, current scanners like fMRI or PET are not suitable as bedside monitors. Potential smaller monitors such as EEG or fNIRS have not been shown to produce sufficient information that warrants their usage on a continuous basis. Furthermore, full head sensors are cumbersome, and require a technician. We present a novel functional three-electrode brain activity sensor (fBAS), which is based on a functional brain activity separation algorithm. It processes the EEG data (in real time) and produces a large number of brain activity features (BAF), which are correlated with different functional neural network. It appears to be a promising tool for assessment, treatment and monitoring of DOC patients. The functional separation algorithm is based on Harmonic Analysis decomposition inspired by Coifman and Wickerhauser (1992, IEEE Trans. Info Theo.; Neretti & Intrator, 2002, IEEE NNSP). Method(s): Three patients with minimal consciousness due to TBI (2 patients) and anoxic brain damage (1 patient) were monitored during a period of 1 month. During this time, recording of at least 5 h/week were obtained. The recordings were performed during sleep, during alertness state without additional stimulation ('rest'), and during multimodal sensory stimulation (passive movements and auditory, smell, gustatory and visual stimuli). Patients were also asked to perform guided imagery tasks Results: Changes in brain activity were observed as different senses were stimulated. It was possible to quantify which senses respond more strongly and to what type of stimuli. For example, it was possible to determine to what taste there was a stronger response, or whether there was a stronger response to auditory or visual stimuli. In some cases, response to stimulus on the right side was radically different than response to stimulus on the left side. In one case, there was no response to visual stimuli but strong response to auditory stimuli. Clear response to guided imagery was observed in two patients. Conclusion(s): A three-electrode EEG sensor with advanced signal processing is able to provide indication of brain activity in response to various stimuli. It can also provide response indication to guided imagery, which indicates preserved higher order cognitive functioning. This may become a promising method for assessment and continuous monitoring of DOC patients.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,NA,828-829,NA,6-7,31,NA,Brain Inj.,NA,"12th World Congress on Brain Injury of the International Brain Injury Association.

Researchers have been actively improving hand gesture recognition technology in many applications such as sign language recognition, augmented reality, visual interfaces, and robot control over the past few decades. Recognition of surgeon's hand performing surgical task is far more complex in comparison to hand gesture recognition in sign language and visual interfaces due to self-occlusion of fingers and cluttered scenes. Some researches addressed the task of recognizing surgeon's action using a conventional CCD camera capturing 2D images, or a 3D depth scanner which is now widely available as consumer depth camera such as KinectTM (Microsoft Co. Ltd., USA). Recent studies on surgical task recognition show that images can be as effective as 3D motion data, both yielding promising results in surgical task and surgical phase recognition [1]. The work presented here aimed at incorporating 3D image data and 3D motion data obtained from a depth camera to develop a vision-based surgical task recognition system. In this study, we leverage machine learning techniques and computer vision to recognize surgeon's hand pose in open surgeries in order to understand basic surgical tasks such as clamping, suturing and cutting. We investigate the feasibility of applying depth motion maps (DMMs) [2], one of the state-of-the-art human activity and hand gesture recognition methods, combining with our proposed hand trajectory features to recognize four basic surgical tasks by performing data acquisition, feature extraction, feature normalization, and classification on our dataset. Method(s): Recognition of hand pose in surgical tasks was achieved by performing classification on the depth video sequence of surgeon's hand movement based on a model trained by four basic surgical actions with support vector machine (SVM). To capture surgeon's hand movement, a Kinect sensor was placed roughly at 1.0 m above the surgery bed. The resolution of the depth image was 512 x 424 pixels. The depth resolution was 1 mm and the frame rate of the depth video sequence was set to be 10 frames per second. For each depth video sequence, surgeon's hand was segmented using depth threshold. The segmented depth sequence was then projected to form depth motion maps (DMMs). Local binary pattern (LBPs) [3] features were then extracted from the DMMs. In addition to DMM-LBP features, hand trajectory features were also extracted. These extracted feature vectors were then normalized before they were fed to the classifier. DMMs were computed from a depth video sequence by projecting each depth map onto three orthogonal Cartesian planes to form three projected maps at first, then accumulating the absolute difference between consecutive projected maps as follows: DMMv = SIGMAmapi+1v-mapifrom i = 1to i = N - 1 (1) where N is the number of frame, i is the frame index, vs{front, side, top} is the projected view, and mapv stands for the projected map. Our proposed trajectory feature consists of the trajectory mean (Tmean), the size and pixel count of trajectory image (Itrajectory), and the motion energy of each DMM (Ev). Let Tbe the trajectory of surgeon's hand, T = {(xi,yi,zi)i = 1,... -,N} (2) Tmean = (1/N)SIGMA(xi,yi, zi) from i = 1to i = N (3) Itrajectory (x, y) = 1 if x = xi, y = yi Itrajectory (x,y) = 0 otherwise (4) Ev = SIGMApixels DMMv (5) where (xi, yi, zi) is the centroid of the hand, N is the number of trajectory points, and v  {front, side, top}. Result(s): We created a dataset consists of depth video sequences of four basic surgical tasks-clamping tissue, passing a suturing needle through tissue with a needle holder, dissecting tissue with a scalpel, and cutting tissue with a scissors. We also included a class for other tasks. Each task was repeated 10 times by four subjects and varied from 10 frames to 50 frames. DMMs of all video sequences were resized to a fixed size, which is equal to 1/2 of their mean size, to reduce intra-class variation. We performed two experiments on our dataset to compare the classification accuracy: (1) DMM-LBP feature without the proposed trajectory features, and (2) DMM-LBP feature with the proposed trajectory features. Leave-one-subject-out cross validation was used to evaluate the classification accuracy of our dataset. Each training set was created by taking the samples of any three subjects from the total number of four subjects, and the test setbeingthe samples of one subject that was left out. Support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function (RBF) kernel was used to evaluate the classification accuracy of the dataset (Fig. 1). (Figure presented) Our result shows that the prediction mean accuracy has increased from 92.0 +/- 2.8 to 95.0 +/- 4.2%, with approximately 3.0% increase when trajectory features were employed on top of the DMM-LBP features. Figure 2 shows the confusion matrix of our basic surgical tasks prediction with DMM-LBP and the proposed trajectory features. We also achieved about 0.97% accuracy increase when we tested our proposed trajectory feature on top of the author's original implementation on the MSRGesture3D public database. (Figure presented) Conclusion(s): We showed the feasibility of recognition hand pose in basic surgical tasks using DMM-LBP feature combined with hand trajectory features. In our study, only four classes of specific surgical tasks were evaluated. In the future, more classes will be addressed in order to recognize practical variety of surgical tasks.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,NA,S109-S110,NA,1 Supplement 1,12,NA,Int. J.

Background(s): Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both. Cervical dystonia (CD) is the most common form of dystonia. Method(s): We prospectively evaluated 69 patients with CD. Clinical data were collected from medical records, repercussions of dystonia by the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS), functionality was assessed by the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and postural measures assessed with postural the Analysis Software. Statistical analysis was performed from principal component analysis (PCA), after verification of data quality by the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin method (KMO test).

When the scores used for measuring the level of impact of the repercussions of CD were correlated with the FIM and postural measures, we found that the higher the level of severity and impact of the CD, the worse the postural pattern and the less independence to move from bed to chair and using the toilet. However, the level of impact was lower in younger subjects.

Background(s): Sleep disturbance is a common non-motor symptom of PD with negative impact on patients' health and quality of life. Wearable biosensors incorporating 3-axis accelerometers (actigraphy), have the potential to generate objective, passively collected digital biomarkers that advance drug development, research and clinical care. Use of actigraphy to measure sleep in PD has, to date, been limited by poor correlation between actigraphy metrics and gold-standard polysomnography (PSG), and by operational challenges in achieving compliance with good clinical practice (GCP). Method(s): Consenting subjects with PD and elderly controls wore a raw actigraphy device overnight during simultaneous sleep lab PSG assessment, and at home 24/7 for 14 days when daily sleep diaries were completed. The correlations between PSG-derived sleep efficiency (% of time in bed spent asleep) and the standard ESS actigraphy algorithms1 were explored. ""Deep learning"" techniques (an artificial intelligence concept mimicking neural networks found in the human brain) were then applied to the synchronised raw actigraphy and PSG data to develop a new algorithm ""DLS"" for interpretation of sleep metrics in elderly and PD subjects. This DLS algorithm was then applied to data that had not been used in the deep learning process to quantify agreement between actigraphy- and PSG-derived sleep efficiency. Result(s): Data from 26 subjects (22 controls, 4 PD) are presented. Deep learning algorithm DLS results were better correlated with PSG than standard ESS algorithms (r=0.81 r=0.52) and reduced average error by ~50%. Training the developed convolutional neural network (CNN) to characterize daytime activity (including motor symptoms such as tremor) improved the correct characterisation of night-time sleep/wake status. Conclusion(s): Actigraphy offers potential for the passive, objective measurement of sleep, with acceptable correlation with gold standard PSG when clinical and physiological status is taken into account, and can be incorporated into a GCP compliant data management framework for clinical trial use.

Background(s): Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both. CD is the most common form of dystonia. Design/Methods: We prospectively evaluated 69 patients with CD. Clinical data were collected from medical records, repercussions of dystonia by the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS), functionality was assessed by the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and postural measures assessed with postural the Analysis Software (SAPO). Statistical analysis was performed from principal component analysis (PCA), after verification of data quality by the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin method (KMO test). The correlation matrix between variables was evaluated with the sphericity Bartlett's test and setting the number of principal components was established through the Broken-stick test. Result(s): Correlation between time of diagnosis and functions of FIM showed that the shorter the time of diagnosis, the greater the patients' independence to perform daily activities such as being able to feed themselves, do personal hygiene, get dressed to the waist and from the waist down, use the toilet, use the shower, walk up and down stairs and solve problems. When the scores used for measuring the level of impact of the repercussions of CD were correlated with the FIM and postural measures, we found that the higher the level of severity and impact of the CD, the worse the postural pattern and the less independence to move from bed to chair and using the toilet. However, the level of impact was lower in younger subjects. Conclusion(s): The progression of the disease and the impact of CD were directly correlated with the functionality and the postural characteristics of patients.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,NA,NA,NA,16 Supplement 1,88,NA,Neurology,NA,"69th American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting, AAN 2017.

We investigated the viability of an alternate home-based recording system, SleepSmart, which combines sensing technologies integrated in a bedsheet and 3D video to detect movements. Method(s): Pilot study: 19 participants were administered the SIT in the Biomechanics Lab; the subject lay on an angled bed for 30 minutes and slept for up to 90 minutes. We used a combination of the Kinect videography system enabling conventional 2D and novel 3D-technology, a portable EMG device, and a mattress topper sheet fitted with flexible sensors. EMG data was recorded for both tibialis anterior muscles. The goal was to perform pilot testing on the integrated system to fine tune the procedure and equipment. Result(s): Main findings: The 3-D video recordings enabled the study of movement developments, a novel feature not captured by 2-D video- recordings and/or EMG. Pitfalls in the EMG setup, overall protocol design, and data synchronization were encountered. Several requirements were identified to optimize the test-setup: (1) A millisecond-level time stamping system was needed to sync data between multiple modalities; this mechanism will support identification of movement characteristics (development and peak) for Periodic Limb Movements (PLM). (2) Reflective or light-absorbing artifacts should be removed to maintain video data integrity. (3) With the demonstrated effectiveness of the video-data characterization feature, the mattress-sensor framework should implement machine learning algorithms to automatically identify movement events. Conclusion(s): Based on findings, the mattress sensors are being replaced with newer sensors to improve performance. The switch from force-sensing resistors (FSRs) to accelerometers incorporates detection of physiological signals (heartbeat and breathing rate). Identification algorithms will include sleep apnea events.

The ability to model and predict these measures could therefore be immensely beneficial in the treatment and prevention of mental illness. However, predicting self-reported health, stress, and happiness is a difficult problem often requiring large, multi-modal datasets. We show that the accuracy for predicting next-day wellbeing is improved when including simple sleep features. Method(s): Data from 144 college students were collected during a 30-day study. Participants wore two sensors to collect actigraphy and physiology data, installed a data logger on their smartphone, and filled out online surveys. Participants self-reported daily on three wellbeing measures (stress - calm; sad - happy; sick - healthy) using a visual analog scale (later scored 0 to 100). The top and bottom 40% of scores were assigned positive and negative labels, respectively. A hierarchical bayes machine learning algorithm was trained to predict each next-day wellbeing label on two data sets: (1) including self-reported sleep features (e.g., self-reported sleep latency, bedtime, and wake time), and (2) discarding sleep features. Both data sets include approximately 20 features computed from wearable sensors, phone, and online surveys. In total, 2,769 days of data were used. Result(s): Without including the sleep features, hold-out test accuracies for stress, happiness, and healthy were 79.62%, 78.24%, 83.55%, respectively. When including sleep features, the accuracies were improved for the stress and happy predictions to 80.67%, 80.40%, respectively; however the healthy prediction accuracy worsened slightly to 83.12%. Using McNemar's test we find that including sleep features does not significantly improve the classifiers for the stress or healthy prediction, but does significantly improve the classifier for the happy prediction (p<0.15). Conclusion(s): The inclusion of sleep features improved the prediction of next-data self-reported stress/calm and happy/sad metric of individuals above a classifier using features from smartphones and wearables. Future studies of personalized prediction of happy/sad and stress/ calm ought to consider including self-reported sleep features in order to improve prediction.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,NA,A294-A295,NA,Supplement 1,40,NA,Sleep,NA,"31st Anniversary Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC, SLEEP 2017.

Previous observations suggested atypical patterns of heart rate changes in people with depression, often marked by elevated and unstable heart rate during sleep. This study assessed the validity of novel biomarkers based on heart rate changes across the sleep period to discriminate between individuals with depression and healthy controls. Method(s): Retrospective data was collated in 993 adults: 545 with unipolar depressive syndromes referred to a specialized sleep clinic (74% females, mean+/-SD: 45 +/- 16 years old), and 448 healthy controls (55% females, mean+/-SD: 40 +/- 18 years old). Electrocardiography started before bedtime and extended beyond sleep offset. Sleep-based heart rate profiles were defined by a classification algorithm using a panel of temporal and frequency domain variables designed to distinguish between depression and control cases. A subset of 630 cases (315 depression & 315 controls) was randomly selected for training the machine-learning algorithm, and the remaining 259 cases (125 depression & 134 controls) were used for testing the algorithm. This process was repeated ten times with different subsets to assess classification stability. Result(s): After training, the algorithm classified individuals with depressive syndrome and healthy controls with a mean accuracy of 86%. More specifically, 82% of the depression cases were correctly identified by the algorithm (i.e. sensitivity) and, of the cases not classified as depression by the algorithm, 88% were from the control group (i.e. specificity). Conclusion(s): The algorithm's ability to distinguish between clinical groups based on heart rate changes across sleep is encouraging for the identification of objective biomarkers of depression. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular changes across sleep in the context of depression remain to be further investigated. Yet, the present results suggest that heart rate profiles during sleep may be useful as adjunctive assessment measures for depression.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,NA,A405-A406,NA,Supplement 1,40,NA,Sleep,NA,"31st Anniversary Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC, SLEEP 2017.

The Relationship Between Body Mass Index and Space Required to Turn in Bed,Nursing research,NA,1538-9847 (electronic),10.1097/NNR.0000000000000242,NA,"BACKGROUND: A bed that is too small to allow patients to turn from supine to side lying increases the difficulty of mobilizing patients, which can increase risk of musculoskeletal injury to caregivers, increase risk of pressure injuries to patients, and reduce patient comfort. Currently, no guidance is available for what patient sizes are accommodated by the standard 91cm (36 in.)-wide hospital bed, and no studies have evaluated the relationship between anthropometric attributes and space required to turn in bed., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to determine how much space individuals occupy when turning from supine to side lying as predicted by their anthropometry (i.e., body dimensions) to establish guidance on selecting the appropriate bed size., METHODS: Forty-seven adult participants (24 female) with body mass index (BMI) from 20 to 76 kg/m participated in a laboratory study. Body dimensions were measured, and the envelope of space required to turn was determined using motion capture. Linear regressions estimated the relationship between anthropometric attributes and space occupied when turning., RESULTS: BMI was strongly correlated (R = .88) with the space required to turn. Based on the linear regressions, individuals with BMI up to 35 kg/m could turn left and right within 91 cm and individuals with BMI up to 45 kg/m could turn one direction within 91 cm., DISCUSSION: BMI is a good predictor of the space required to turn from supine to lateral. Nurses should consider placing patients that are unable to laterally reposition themselves on a wider bed when BMI is greater than 35 kg/m and should consider placing all patients greater than 45 kg/m on a wider bed regardless of mobility. Hospital administrators can use historical demographic information about the BMI of their patient populations to plan facility-level equipment procurement for equipment that accommodates their patients.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,NA,483-489,NA,6,66,NA,Nurs Res,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed18&NEWS=N&AN=619700518,physiologic monitoring; human; adult; female; male; *obesity; body position; movement (physiology); *bed; *bed rest; *body mass,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Design(s): Prospective, observational study. Setting(s): Surgical ICU at an academic hospital. Patient(s): Three hundred sixty-two hours of sensor color and depth image data were recorded and curated into 109 segments, each containing 1,000 images, from eight patients. Intervention(s): None. Measurements and Main Results: Three Microsoft Kinect sensors (Microsoft, Beijing, China) were deployed in one ICU room to collect continuous patient mobility data. We developed software that automatically analyzes the sensor data to measure mobility and assign the highest level within a time period. To characterize the highest mobility level, a validated 11-point mobility scale was collapsed into four categories: nothing in bed, in-bed activity, out-of-bed activity, and walking. Of the 109 sensor segments, the noninvasive mobility sensor was developed using 26 of these from three ICU patients and validated on 83 remaining segments from five different patients. Three physicians annotated each segment for the highest mobility level. The weighted Kappa (kappa) statistic for agreement between automated noninvasive mobility sensor output versus manual physician annotation was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.72-1.00). Disagreement primarily occurred in the ""nothing in bed"" versus ""in-bed activity"" categories because ""the sensor assessed movement continuously,"" which was significantly more sensitive to motion than physician annotations using a discrete manual scale. Conclusion(s): Noninvasive mobility sensor is a novel and feasible method for automating evaluation of ICU patient mobility.Copyright © 2017 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The proposed device is designed to impose minimum data acquisition hazards on the subject. In standard bedside monitors, HR and RR are derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiration signals, respectively, and different electrodes are required for capturing the 12-lead ECG and respiration via a chest belt, which is cumbersome for patients and healthcare providers. Respiration signal has an impact on ECG due to anatomical proximity of the heart and lung, and ECG is modulated by respiration, a phenomenon known as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). In the proposed method, the ECG signal is acquired using clip electrodes at the wrists and the respiration signal is extracted from the ECG using an Arduino Uno microcontroller-based real-time processing of ECG. RR is then derived from ECG-derived respiration (EDR). The prototype is tested on healthy subjects and compared to measurements taken using a standard MP45 data acquisition device associated with a Biopac Student Lab (BSL). A mean percentage error of 5.54+/-8.48% was observed under normal breathing conditions and an error of -3.41+/-3.27% was observed for a single subject tested under a variety of breathing conditions, such as resting, stair-climbing, and paced breathing. The proposed algorithm can also be used in combination with standard ECG monitoring systems to measure HR and RR, without any data acquisition hazard to the subject.Copyright © 2017 by ASME.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,2022-08-24T07:29:35Z,NA,024502,NA,2,11,NA,J.

This study is conducted over 20 volunteers to measure the movement and heart rate (HR) using two different sensor designs placed at two different bed locations. Three different processing methods are developed and tested in order to extract useful information from the measured data. The results suggest that a stretched fiber optic configuration under the head of the person lying in bed is the optimal configuration to detect HR and motion, nonetheless the other tested possibilities also exhibit remarkably good performances. On the other hand, the three proposed processing methods also achieve a good precision in the HR detection. The sensor implementation is simple, not requiring any special conditions, and it provides robust performance.

This work presents a technique to detect life threatening arrhythmias using only PPG waveforms. PhysioNet Challenge 2015 data is used to detect five types of arrhythmias namely, tachycardia, bradycardia, asystole, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. A novel technique is employed to assign pulse quality index to every PPG pulse and highest quality portion of the signal is used for detection.

Besides an increase in sedentary behaviour, pain in RA can negatively impact simple physical activities such as getting out of bed and standing up from a chair. The objective of this work is to develop a method that can generate fine-grained actigraphies to capture the impact of the disease on the daily activities of patients. A processing methodology is presented to automatically tag activity accelerometer data from a cohort of moderate-to-severe RA patients. A study of procesing methods based on machine learning and deep learning is provided. Thirty subjects, 10 RA patients and 20 healthy control subjects, were recruited in the study. A single tri-axial accelerometer was attached to the position of the fifth lumbar vertebra (L5) of each subject with a tag prediction granularity of 3 s. The proposed method is capable of handling unbalanced datasets from tagged data while accounting for long-duration activities such as sitting and lying, as well as short transitions such as sit-to-stand or lying-to-sit. The methodology also includes a novel mechanism for automatically applying a threshold to predictions by their confidence levels, in addition to a logical filter to correct for infeasible sequences of activities.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to investigate the cooling efficacy of ice-sheet cooling (ISC) following exertional hyperthermia., METHODS: 13 (11 males, 2 females) participants (age = 23 +/- 3 years, height = 176.5 +/- 10.3 cm, mass = 78.6 +/- 15.3 kg, body fat = 19.6 +/- 8.6%, and body surface area = 1.95 +/- 0.22 m2) volunteered to complete 2 randomized, crossover design trials on an outdoor recreation field (34.4 +/- 1.4degreeC, 54.4 +/- 4.1% relative humidity). Each trial consisted of exercise (self-paced 400-m warm-up, 1,609-m run, and 100-m sprints) followed by 15 minutes of either lying supine in the shade with no treatment (control [CON]) or being treated with ice-water soaked sheets wrapped around their body (ISC). Physiological (rectal temperature [Tre], heart rate, mean-weighted skin temperature) and perceptual measures (thermal sensation, rating of perceived exertion) were assessed after each exercise protocol, every 3 minutes during treatment, and every 5 minutes during recovery., FINDINGS: By design, there were no differences during exercise between ISC and CON for Tre (p = 0.16), skin temperature (p = 0.52), heart rate (p = 0.62), thermal sensation (p = 0.89), or rating of perceived exertion (p = 0.99). There were greater decreases in Tre at 3 (ISC 0.33 +/- 0.26degreeC vs. CON 0.03 +/- 0.30degreeC, p = 0.01) and 6 minutes (ISC 0.47 +/- 0.27degreeC vs. CON 0.30 +/- 0.19degreeC, p = 0.05) of treatment; however, the overall rate of cooling was not different between trials (CON 0.05 +/- 0.02degreeC/min vs. ISC 0.06 +/- 0.02degreeC/min, p = 0.72). Skin temperature (Tsk) was significantly reduced from 3 minutes (ISC 34.4 +/- 1.7degreeC vs. CON 36.6 +/- 0.5degreeC, p = 0.007) through 15 minutes (ISC 32.4 +/- 1.5 vs. CON 36.1 +/- 0.4degreeC, p < 0.001) of treatment. There was a trend for lower heart rate with ISC (p = 0.051). Thermal sensation was reduced from 3 minutes of treatment (ISC 3.5 +/- 0.9 vs. CON 4.5 +/- 0.6, p = 0.002) through 15 minutes (ISC 2.8 +/- 1.0 vs. CON 3.9 +/- 0.4, p = 0.005)., DISCUSSION: ISC does not provide effective reduction in Tre following exertional hyperthermia compared to no treatment. However, perceptual benefits may warrant the use of ISC in settings where rapid reductions in core temperature are not a concern (i.e., recovery from exercise). Thus, clinicians should continue to utilize validated techniques (i.e., cold-water immersion) for the treatment of exertional heat illnesses.Reprint & Copyright © 2017 Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S.",2017,2022-08-24T07:29:36Z,2022-08-24T07:29:36Z,NA,e1951-e1957,NA,9,182,NA,Mil Med,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United Kingdom,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed18&NEWS=N&AN=622292099,physiologic monitoring; physiology; human; adult; female; male; devices; body temperature; *procedures; *standards; *exercise; fever/th [Therapy]; ice cover; relative density; thermoregulation; thermotherapy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such applications call for monitoring methods in which the patient's natural state is less interfered with. An ideal device would be non-invasive, minimally restrictive, robust enough to compensate movements of the patients, and would operate without relying on the patient's full cooperation., OBJECTIVE: This paper focuses on the design and development of an unobtrusive vital signs monitoring system particularly suited for long-term monitoring placed under the mattresses., APPROACH: The system is based on the magnetic induction sensing method, designed to infer presence on the bed, breathing and cardiac activity, and consists of two coils for excitation and detection. The new detection coil is based on a concentric planar gradiometer for canceling the primary field. The signal acquisition system has been designed using simple electronics to avoid ending up with a complex and expensive system. The experimental results were compared with reference signals coming from other known sensors with different technical bases for benchmarking and identifying the advantages and/or drawbacks of the new system regarding other techniques. The designed system was also studied in regards to safety standards and limitations for the exposure to the magnetic fields., MAIN RESULTS: Experimental results confirm the suitability and safety of the sensor for long-term cardiac and respiratory monitoring.

The development of efficient algorithms for the quality control of long diagnostic electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings, both single- and multi-lead, and of the arterial blood pressure (ABP) signal is therefore essential for the enhancement of care quality. The ECG signal is often corrupted by noise, which can be within the frequency band of interest and can manifest similar morphologies as the ECG itself. Similarly to ECG, also the ABP signal is often corrupted by non-Gaussian, nonlinear and non-stationary noise and artifacts, especially in ICU recordings. Moreover, the reliability of several important parameters derived from ABP such as systolic blood pressure or pulse pressure is strongly affected by the quality of the ABP waveform. In this work, several up-to-date algorithms for the quality scoring of a single- or multi-lead ECG recording, based on time-domain approaches, frequency-domain approaches or a combination of the two will be reviewed, as well as methods for the quality assessment of ABP. Additionally, algorithms exploiting the relationship between ECG and pulsatile signals, such as ABP and photoplethysmographic recordings, for the reduction in the false alarm rate will be presented. Finally, some considerations will be drawn taking into account the large heterogeneity of clinical settings, applications and goals that the reviewed algorithms have to deal with.Copyright © 2016, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.",2016,2022-08-24T07:29:36Z,2022-08-24T07:29:36Z,NA,1025-1035,NA,7,54,NA,Med.

We have developed a portable ambulatory motion recorder (the NIGHT-Recorder), which consists of 16-bit triaxial integrated microelectromechanical system inertial sensors that are specifically designed to measure movements, register the position of the body with respect to gravity, and provide information on rotations on the longitudinal axis while lying in bed. The signal processing uses the forward derivative method to identify rolling over and getting out of bed as primary indicators. The prototype was tested on six PD pairs to measure their movements for one night. Using predetermined definitions, 134 movements were captured consisting of rolling over 115 times and getting out of bed 19 times. Patients with PD rolled over significantly fewer times than their spouses (p = 0.03), and the position change was significantly smaller in patients with PD (p = 0.03). Patients with PD rolled over at a significantly slower speed (p = 0.03) and acceleration (p = 0.03) than their spouses. In contrast, patients with PD got out of bed significantly more often than their spouses (p = 0.02). It is technically feasible to develop an easy-to-use, portable, and accurate device that can assist physicians in the assessment of nocturnal movements of patients with PD.Copyright © 2016, Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development.

PUs are very painful for patients and costly for hospitals and nursing homes. Assessment of sleeping parameters on at-risk limbs is critical for ulcer prevention. An effective assessment depends on automatic identification and tracking of at-risk limbs. An accurate limb identification can be used to analyze the pressure distribution and assess risk for each limb. In this paper, we propose a graph-based clustering approach to extract the body limbs from the pressure data collected by a commercial pressure map system. A robust signature-based technique is employed to automatically label each limb. Finally, an assessment technique is applied to evaluate the experienced stress by each limb over time.

Design(s): Observational cohort study. Setting(s): Twenty-four-bed trauma step-down unit. Patient(s): Two thousand one hundred fifty-three patients. Intervention(s): Noninvasive vital sign monitoring data (heart rate, respiratory rate, peripheral oximetry) recorded on all admissions at 1/20 Hz, and noninvasive blood pressure less frequently, and partitioned data into training/validation (294 admissions; 22,980 monitoring hours) and test sets (2,057 admissions; 156,177 monitoring hours). Alerts were vital sign deviations beyond stability thresholds. A four-member expert committee annotated a subset of alerts (576 in training/validation set, 397 in test set) as real or artifact selected by active learning, upon which we trained machine-learning algorithms. The best model was evaluated on test set alerts to enact online alert classification over time. Measurements and Main Results: The Random Forest model discriminated between real and artifact as the alerts evolved online in the test set with area under the curve performance of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67-0.93) for peripheral oximetry at the instant the vital sign first crossed threshold and increased to 0.87 (95% CI, 0.71-0.95) at 3 minutes into the alerting period. Blood pressure area under the curve started at 0.77 (95% CI, 0.64-0.95) and increased to 0.87 (95% CI, 0.71-0.98), whereas respiratory rate area under the curve started at 0.85 (95% CI, 0.77-0.95) and increased to 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-1.00). Heart rate alerts were too few for model development. Conclusion(s): Machine-learning models can discern clinically relevant peripheral oximetry, blood pressure, and respiratory rate alerts from artifacts in an online monitoring dataset (area under the curve > 0.87).Copyright © 2016 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",2016,2022-08-24T07:29:36Z,2022-08-24T07:29:36Z,NA,e456-e463,NA,7,44,NA,Crit.

The added value of vital sign trends over time is poorly characterized. We investigated whether adding trends improves accuracy and which methods are optimal for modelling trends. Method(s): Patients admitted to five hospitals over a five-year period were included in this observational cohort study, with 60% of the data used for model derivation and 40% for validation. Vital signs were utilized to predict the combined outcome of cardiac arrest, intensive care unit transfer, and death. The accuracy of models utilizing both the current value and different trend methods were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Result(s): A total of 269,999 patient admissions were included, which resulted in 16,452 outcomes. Overall, trends increased accuracy compared to a model containing only current vital signs (AUC 0.78 vs. 0.74; p < 0.001). The methods that resulted in the greatest average increase in accuracy were the vital sign slope (AUC improvement 0.013) and minimum value (AUC improvement 0.012), while the change from the previous value resulted in an average worsening of the AUC (change in AUC -0.002). The AUC increased most for systolic blood pressure when trends were added (AUC improvement 0.05). Conclusion(s): Vital sign trends increased the accuracy of models designed to detect critical illness on the wards. Our findings have important implications for clinicians at the bedside and for the development of early warning scores.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",2016,2022-08-24T07:29:37Z,2022-08-24T07:29:37Z,NA,1-5,NA,"(Churpek, Adhikari, Edelson) Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States",102,NA,Resuscitation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Ireland Publisher: Elsevier Ireland Ltd,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed17&NEWS=N&AN=608648523,article; human; priority journal; adult; female; major clinical study; male; accuracy; cohort analysis; controlled study; receiver operating characteristic; comparative study; observational study; multicenter study; heart arrest; survival rate; hospital admission; intensive care; heart rate; oxygen saturation; *vital sign; breathing rate; systolic blood pressure; diastolic blood pressure; *physiologic monitoring; *deterioration; mortality rate; cardiovascular mortality,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the cause of delirium is unknown. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to assess brain tissue oxygenation in patients with septic shock, who are at high risk of developing delirium. Method(s): This prospective observational study was conducted in a 33-bed general medical surgical intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were eligible for recruitment. The FORESIGHT NIRS monitor was used to assess brain tissue oxygenation in the frontal lobes for the first 72 hours of ICU admission. Physiological data was also recorded. We used the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU to screen for delirium. Result(s): From March 1st 2014-September 30th 2014, 10 patients with septic shock were recruited. The NIRS monitor captured 81% of the available data. No adverse events were recorded. Brain tissue oxygenation demonstrated significant intra- and inter-individual variability in the way it correlated with physiological parameters, such as mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation. Mean brain tissue oxygen levels were significantly lower in patients who were delirious for the majority of their ICU stay. Conclusion(s): It is feasible to record brain tissue oxygenation with NIRS in patients with septic shock. This study provides the infrastructure necessary for a larger prospective observational study to further examine the relationship between brain tissue oxygenation, physiological parameters, and acute neurological dysfunction.Copyright © The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences Inc. 2015.",2016,2022-08-24T07:29:37Z,2022-08-24T07:29:37Z,NA,65-73,NA,1,43,NA,Can.

In this study, we present a pioneering attempt for MSS detection using full night audio analysis. Our working hypothesis is that there might be differences in sound properties within each MSS due to breathing efforts (or snores) and body movements in bed. In this study, audio signals of 35 patients referred to a sleep laboratory were recorded and analyzed. An additional 178 subjects were used to train a probabilistic time-series model for MSS staging across the night. The audio-based system was validated on 20 out of the 35 subjects. System accuracy for estimating (detecting) epoch-by-epoch wake/REM/NREM states for a given subject is 74% (69% for wake, 54% for REM, and 79% NREM). Mean error (absolute difference) was 36+/-34 min for detecting total sleep time, 17+/-21 min for sleep latency, 5+/-5% for sleep efficiency, and 7+/-5% for REM percentage. These encouraging results indicate that audio-based analysis can provide a simple and comfortable alternative method for ambulatory evaluation of sleep and its disorders.",2016,2022-08-24T07:29:37Z,2022-08-24T07:29:37Z,NA,2847-2850,NA,NA,2016,NA,Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed17&NEWS=N&AN=617206157,polysomnography; sound; human; procedures; biological model; adult; female; male; aged; middle aged; very elderly; young adult; automated pattern recognition; *algorithm; *wakefulness; *sleep stage; *movement (physiology); *abnormal respiratory sound,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study we investigated the possibility of in-line monitoring of temperature inside a fluid bed granulation chamber by using artificial neural network (ANN), which helps predict the temperature distribution and provides a better insight into the established conditions during the granulation process (2). MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Lactose monohydrate (Biopharm Industry, Algeria) was used as a model filler with d50 = 29.56 mum and an aqueous solution of 5% w/w of Povidone K30 (Prochima Sigma, Algeria) as a sprayed binder. Experiment Twelve experiments were carried out in a fluid bed granulator and all the operating conditions remained constant during trials. Two process parameters were varied for the experiments, the fluidizing air temperature in four levels (45, 55 and 65 ml/min) and the spraying rate in three levels (5, 10, 15 and 20 ml/min), the spraying air pressure and batch size were kept constant at 2 bars and 200 g, respectively. Temperature measurements inside the fluid bed chamber were made with the use of nine thermocouples divided into three sets and fixed with vertical steel supports at 50, 130, 210 mm from the distribution plate allowing a back and forth movement of the thermocouples inside the chamber from the centre axis to the walls (Fig. 1). The thermocouples were connected to a data acquisition hardware enabling the recording of temperature variation each second. The signals were displayed in a chart of temperature function of time and were analyzed in-line using the Pico program (Pico Technology, Germany). Data processing For the prediction of temperature profiles, we used the ANNs toolbox on MATLAB (R2014a, MathWorks). The architecture of the designed model was built in one input layer, one output layer and a number of hidden layers. The input layer contains four neurons (Inlet air temperature, spraying rate, position on the X axis, position on the Y axis), the output layer contains one neuron for the temperature measured by the thermocouples and the number of hidden layers was determined through iterations until reaching the lowest mean square error. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION For the developed model used in this study, 436 data from temperature measurements were divided into three categories, the training, the validation and the test (Fig.2). Using the feedforward backpropagation algorithm, the optimal architecture was selected for R(all)=0.996 and corresponded to two hidden layers with twelve neurons in each hidden layer. Characterization of the predicted temperature distribution The predicted temperature distributions are characterized by a defined yellow band that outlines the transition between low and high temperature zones. The shape of these bands is defined by the operating conditions as they determine the path of the granules circulating up and down inside the fluid bed chamber. The predicted temperature distributions and profile shapes correspond to the passage from a thermal zone to another and exhibit two main shapes, a bell and a funnel shape. A bell shape for high spraying rate and low inlet air temperature and a funnel shape for low spraying rate and high inlet air temperature. The selection of the appropriate temperature profile helps control the granulation process and predict the final quality attributes of the granules. Growth mechanism and temperature profiles The agglomeration occurs under the wetting phase of the granulation process. The size of the wetting zone determines the amount of particles available to bind and agglomerate and is dependent on the critical process parameters and will therefore influence the quality attributes of the granules. CONCLUSIONS The possibility of an in-line monitoring of temperature distribution profiles and prediction of granulation process was demonstrated. The acquisition of temperature data under PAT enabled the development of an ANN model for the prediction and making of temperature mappings. The characteristics of these temperature distributions were found to be influenced by the process parameters and hence determine the circulation patterns of particles during granulation and their final properties.",2016,2022-08-24T07:29:37Z,2022-08-24T07:29:37Z,NA,181-182,NA,SPEC.

Diastolic dysfunction (DD) is a well-recognized complication following HT and is associated with increased mortality in adult patients. We sought to evaluate the value of bedside physiologic monitoring data in the identification of pediatric patients with diastolic dysfunction following HT. Method(s): We performed a retrospective cohort study of infants and children undergoing orthotopic HT at our institution over a two-year period Physiologic variables, including heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP) and oxygen saturation, were captured every two seconds from the bedside monitors for the first 72 hours following surgery. Data were averaged into one-minute values along with per minute vasoactive inotrope scores and plotted as time series. Diastolic function (normal diastolic function vs. DD) was assessed by measurement of the right ventricular end diastolic pressure during the first cardiac catheterization after HT. Pairwise and cross correlations of physiologic variables and vasoactive inotrope scores were calculated and compared. Result(s): There were 13 patients that underwent HT during the period of study. Seven patients had DD (mean right ventricular end diastolic pressure 15 vs. 7.5 mm Hg). Patients with DD had a higher positive pairwise correlation of MAP and CVP at 24 hours (0.305 vs. -0.018, p=0.003) and at 72 hours (0.396 vs. 0.117, p=0.005) as compared to patients with normal diastolic function. Comparisons of +/- 30-minute time lag cross correlations of MAP and CVP demonstrated a similar difference between the groups (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that patients with DD following HT can be identified using a predictive monitoring approach through the assessment of MAP and CVP pairwise and cross correlations.

We previously identified non-personalized risk trajectory groups (1). We now hypothesize that a personalized view of risk evolution that takes into account each individual patient own baseline risk may provide additional insight into CRI risk evolution. Method(s): We collected noninvasive vital sign (VS) from bedside monitors in a 24-bed step-down unit (SDU) over 15mo for heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation at 1/20Hz, and intermittently recorded systolic and diastolic blood pressure. CRI risk was estimated using a machine learning model trained on data from first 3mo. Three risk trajectory groups based on evolution time: rapid onset [RAPID), gradual early-onset [SLOW] and constantly high [CONSTANT] were identified, and then nonpersonalized risk was compared to a personalized risk profile which normalized each patient's risk to their own baseline computed within the first 4 hours of SDU admission. Result(s): For 918 instances of CRI (1 instance per unique patient), the non-personalized risk view categorized 67% of instances to RAPID, 19% to SLOW and 15% to CONSTANT risk trajectory groups, respectively. . When using the personalized view, the risk trajectory groups shifted to 83% RAPID 9% SLOW and 8% CONSTANT. Notably, 89% of the patients allocated to the CONSTANT risk group in the non-personalized risk view shifted to the RAPID group in the personalized risk profile. This switch in risk class moved these patients whose initial risk level was high at the time of admission, but whose personalized risk did not elevate further until soon before CRI. Conclusion(s): Most patients in the non-personalized CONSTANT risk evolution trajectory group migrated to the RAPID onset group when risk was personalized to their baseline, identifying individuals at initial high risk who then proceed quickly to CRI and therefore deserve special attention. Therefore both non-personalized and personalized profiles are necessary to render personalized precision care that is adapted to patient's baseline risk.",2016,2022-08-24T07:29:37Z,2022-08-24T07:29:37Z,NA,129,NA,12 Supplement 1,44,NA,Crit.

Medicare flags HAPUs based on inclusion criteria of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient-Safety Indicator 3 (PSI-03), but are sometimes inappropriately coded. To use electronic health records to predict pressure ulcers and to identify coding issues leading to penalties. Method(s): This study applied a multilevel logistic regression to a retrospective cohort of all hospitalized patient electronic medical records at an academic medical center between 2011-2014. Data for this study contained patient-encounter level demographic variables, diagnoses, prescription drugs and provider orders. HAPUs were defined by PSI-03: stages III, IV or unstageable pressure ulcers not present-on-admission as a secondary diagnosis; excluding cases of paralysis. Random forests reduced data dimensionality. Multilevel logistic regression of patient-encounters evaluated associations between covariates and HAPU incidence. Result(s): The approach produced a sample population of 21,153 patients with 1,549 PSI-03 cases. The greatest odds ratio (OR) of HAPU incidence was among patients diagnosed with spinal cord injury (ICD-9 907.2: OR= 14.3; P< 0.001), and 71% of spinal cord injuries were not properly coded for paralysis, leading to a PSI-03 flag. Other high ORs included bed confinement (ICD-9 V49.84: OR= 3.1, P< 0.001), and provider-ordered pre-albumin lab (OR= 2.5, P< 0.001). Conclusion(s): This analysis identifies spinal cord injuries high-risk for HAPUs and often inappropriately coded without paralysis leading to PSI-03 flags. Inappropriate coding of conditions leads to poor hospital performance measures and Medicare reimbursement penalties. AHRQ should exclude spinal cord injury from the PSI-03 flag, and CMS might consider making a payment exception for pressure ulcers concominant with spinal cord injury.

Sleep (polysomnography) and cognitive function (Modified Mini-Mental State exam/3MS, Trails B) data were collected at baseline and 6.5-8 years later. Mortality follow-up was 8 years. Baseline activity patterns and their association with changes in cognition, sleep, and mortality were assessed with models adjusted for education, socioeconomic status, self-rated health, age, mental status, race, anxiety, depression, daytime sleepiness, and history of sleep disruption. Result(s): High fPCA1 values (elevated daily activity) at baseline were associated with a worsening of sleep efficiency (p < 0.05) and more wake after sleep onset (p < 0.05) at follow-up. Low fPCA1 values at baseline were associated with worse Trails B scores (p < 0.001) 6.5 years later. Low fPCA2 values at baseline (earlier wake and bed time) were associated with larger declines (worse) in 3MS scores (p < 0.05) 6.5 years later. Those in quartile 1 (Q1) of fPCA1 had over a 1.6-fold higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR = 1.64 (1.34-2.00)] compared wit h men in Q 4 (p-trend < 0.0001). Menin Q4 of fPCA4 (late afternoon peak in activity) had over a 1.4-fold higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR = 1.46 (1.21-1.77)] compared with men in Q1 (p-trend = 0.0001). Men in Q 4 of f PCA3 (longer du ration of day time activity with a bimodal activity pattern) had over a 1.4-fold higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR = 1.42 (1.02-1.98)] compared with men in Q1 (p-trend = 0.0078). Conclusion(s): Actigraphy-derived patterns of daily activity are associated with changes in clinically-relevant outcome measures, including mortality.

Here we report on a network-based neuroimaging analysis of a vigilance task in which we compare responses based on per for mance (lapse vs. nor mal) and sleep cond ition (SR vs. healthy sleep; HS). Method(s): Thirty-three typically-developing teens ages 14-16 underwent a 3-week within-subject protocol: a baseline week followed by 2 experimental weeks with 5 nights of 6.5 hours (SR) or 10 hours (HS) in bed, with random cross-over and 2-day wash-out. Teens underwent fMRI on the mornings at the end of HS and SR, performing a psychomotor vigilance task that measured reaction time (RT) in response to stimuli presented at random intervals. Imaging data were analyzed using event-related independent component analysis (eICA). G roup eICA, with 20 components, was applied to deconvolved responses separated into those in the normal range of RT (RT = 100-499ms) versus lapses (RT > 500ms). Back-projected timecourses were compared according to RT grouping and sleep condition. Result(s): Ten components described networks relevant to attention or sensory response. We report on response timecourses for an attention-related right-lateralized fronto-parietal network. Post-stimulus, mean response peaked after 6-8 seconds with a significant main effect of RT grouping: mean peak was more marked and occurred later after lapses. There was no main effect of sleep condition on peak height or timing. RT grouping interacted with sleep condition: the peak response was slower during SD than HS for lapses, but not for normal RT. Conclusion(s): This presentation illustrates the ability of eICA to identify distinct brain networks involved in vigilance, allowing subsequent analysis of network-specific response characteristics. Lapses are marked by unusual brain responses in an attention-relevant network, especially during SR. Further analysis will examine additional networks with distinct timecourses.",2016,2022-08-24T07:29:37Z,2022-08-24T07:29:37Z,NA,A96,NA,SUPPL. 1,39,NA,Sleep,NA,"30th Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC, SLEEP 2016.

In this work we investigate the use of machine learning methods, using sleep and wake data, to predict mood. Method(s): We collected 30 days of data each from 68 college students (age: 18-25, 47 male). Throughout the study, participants wore a Q-sensor (Affectiva) on their dominant wrist to measure electrodermal activity, 3-axis acceleration, and skin temperature. And roid phone software monitored location, receiver, sender and timing of calls and SMS, and screen on/off timings. Participants also kept morning and evening diaries about daily activities, social interactions, caffeine, alcohol, and drug intake, and overall mood (on a scale from sad(0) to happy(100)) each day upon awakening and at bedtime. We trained a machine learning algorithm to recognize mood using data from the wearable sensor, phone app, and self-reported activities. In order to accomplish this, we split each participant's mood data into 3 groups labeling the top 30% as ""happy"", the bottom 30% as ""sad"", and discarding the middle. We computed over 700 features and used automated feature selection to identify the most informative features. After comparing six machine learning techniques, we found that a multi-task, multi-kernel learning algorithm performed the best at classifying happiness. Result(s): The method achieved 74% accuracy for evening mood estimation on a hold-out test set. We found that skin conductance and mobile phone usage features between midnight and 8am were among the most informative in classifying evening mood. In par ticular, higher skin conductance activity and lower screen ""on"" durations were associated with ""happy"" evening mood. Conclusion(s): Automated machine learning, applied to nightly data from sensors and smartphones, shows value for predicting college student's mood the following evening.

We used machine-learning (ML) algorithms to classify alarms as alerts or artifacts in VS data streams to assess impact of such a filter on alert rate. Method(s): Patients had VS monitoring data (heart rate [HR], respiratory rate [RR], oximetry [SpO2]) recorded at 1/20Hz. We partitioned data into training/validation (294 admissions; 22,980 hrs) and test sets (2,057 admissions; 156,177 hrs). Alarms are VS deviations beyond stability thresholds, and annotated as real alerts or artifact. We trained a random forest ML algorithm to discriminate alerts from artifact for long alarms (>3 min) and evaluated performance in the test set on both long and short alarms (<3 min) according to how many artifact alarms can be reduced among the total number of alarms (M1); and how many artifact alarms can be correctly filtered from the total artifact alarms (M2). Result(s): Figure 30 shows calculation of M1 (overall alarm duration reduction = 31 %) and M2 (artifact alarm duration reduction = 94 %) The number of artifact alarms in the complete data set is estimated from artifact prevalence in the annotated sample. Figure 31 is the ROC diagram for ML algorithm for both short and long alarms. The vertical line indicates proportion of artifact alarms correctly identified at a false negative rate of 30 % (i.e. % of real alerts incorrectly filtered out). Conclusion(s): This ML filter algorithm can reduce about 94 % of artifact alarms and 31 % of overall alarms, potentially reducing alarm fatigue if applied clinically.

Study design Prospectively enrolled cohort of 60 infants with CHD who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in the first 3 months of life. Infants with a genetic comorbidity were excluded. aEEG was assessed for 12 hours pre- and 48 hours postoperatively. Background pattern was classified by the use of standard categories, and the presence of seizures and sleep-wake cycles (SWCs) was noted. Outcome at 1 and 4 years of age was assessed with standardized developmental tests. Results Preoperatively, infants either showed continuous normal voltage (n=56) or discontinuous normal voltage (n=4). Postoperatively, abnormal background pattern (flat trace, burst suppression, or continuous low voltage) was detected in 7 (12%), discontinuous normal voltage in 37 (61%), and continuous normal voltage in 16 (27%) infants. Nineteen infants (32%) did not return to normal SWCs within the recording period. Seizures were detected in 4 infants preoperatively and in another 4 postoperatively. After we controlled for surgical and postoperative risk factors, abnormal postoperative background pattern and lack of return to SWCs independently predicted poorer intelligence quotient at 4 years (P=.03 and P=.04 respectively) but was not related to motor outcome. Conclusion aEEG is a useful bedside tool that helps to predict outcome in infants undergoing open-heart surgery for CHD. Abnormal postoperative background pattern and lack of return to SWCs are markers for subsequent impaired cognitive development.Copyright © 2016",2016,2022-08-24T07:29:38Z,2022-08-24T07:29:38Z,NA,55-60.e1,NA,"(Latal, Beck) Child Development Center, University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland",178,NA,J.

The possible introduction of storage artefacts is an important potential confounding factor in the development of standard methodologies for breath sampling and analysis. The stability of VOCs trapped from breath samples onto a dual bed Tenax TA:Carbograph adsorbent tube and stored -80degreeC was studied over 12.5 month. 25 samples were collected from a single male participant over 3 h and then stored at -80 degreeC. Randomly selected adsorbent tubes were subsequent analysed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry at 5 times points throughout the 12.5 month of the study. Toluene-d8, decane-d22 and hexadecane-d34 internal standards were used to manage the instrument variability throughout the duration of the study. A breath-matrix consisting of 161 endogenous and 423 exogenous VOC was created. Iterative orthogonal partial least squared discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated that it was not possible to detect storage artefacts at 1.5 month storage. By 6 month storage artefacts were discernible with significant changes observed for 27% of the recovered VOC. Endogenous VOC were observed to be more susceptible to storage. A paired two-tailed t-test on the endogenous compounds indicated that the maximum storage duration under these conditions was 1.5 month with 94% of the VOCs stable. This study indicates that a prudent approach is best adopted for the storage of adsorbent samples; storage times should be minimised, and storage time examined as a possible discriminatory factor in multivariate analysis.Copyright © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2016,2022-08-24T07:29:38Z,2022-08-24T07:29:38Z,NA,026011,NA,2,10,NA,J.

In addition, it provides valuable insight into intrinsic microcirculatory regulation as it yields dynamic, two-dimensional perfusion maps. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of a clinical cbPPG application in critical care patients. Method(s): A mobile camera set-up to record faces of patients at the bed site was constructed. Videos were made during the immediate recovery after cardiac surgery under standard critical care conditions and were processed offline. Major motion artefacts were detected using an optical flow technique and suitable facial regions were manually annotated. cbPPG signals were highpass filtered and Fourier spectra out of consecutive 10s signal segments calculated for heart rate detection. Signalto-noise ratios (SNR) of the Fourier spectra were derived as a quality measure. Reference data of vital parameters were synchronously acquired from the bed site monitoring system. Result(s): Seventy patient videos of an average time of 28.6 +/- 2.8 min were analysed. Heart rate (HR) was detected within a +/- 5 bpm range compared to reference in 83% of total recording time. Low SNR and HR detection failure were mostly, but not exclusively, attributed to non-physiological events like patient motion, interventions or sudden changes of illumination. SNR was reduced by low arterial blood pressure, whereas no impact of other perioperative or disease-related parameters was identified. Conclusion(s): Cardiac ejection is detectable by cbPPG under pathophysiologic conditions of cardiovascular disease and perioperative medicine. cbPPG measurements can be seamlessly integrated into the clinical work flow of critical care patients.Copyright © 2016 IOS Press and the authors.

This paper proposes a machine learning technique to label snoring sounds as belonging toREMorNREMsleep in OSA patients. Our method is based on analysing snore and breathing sound recordings from OSA patients acquired with non-contact bedside microphones. The reference standard to diagnose OSA and sleep states was the laboratory-based clinical polysomnography (PSG).We trained multilevel artificial neural networks (hierarchical neural networks) to label sleep intoREMandNREMclasses using snoring and breathing sounds around a given snoring episode of interest. A total of 41 062 snoring episodes were used for training and testing of the model (training to testing sample ratio was 3:1). The training data set was obtained from 12 subjects and the testing data set was from 7. The two data sets were mutually exclusive. Our method achieved a substantial (Cohen's kappa k=0.62) agreement with the reference standard, that is, the PSG-based clinical classification. Overall, our proposed method achieved 90% testing accuracy of labelling individual snores asREMand NREM.Copyright ©2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.",2016,2022-08-24T07:29:38Z,2022-08-24T07:29:38Z,NA,055022,NA,5,2,NA,Biomed.

This study determined whether MWVSM sensors track vital signs and allow for appropriate triage compared to a gold standard bedside monitor in trauma patients. This was a prospective study in 59 trauma intensive care unit patients. Systolic blood pressure, temperature, heart rate (HR), skin temperature, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) were displayed on a bedside monitor for 60 minutes. Shock index (SI) was calculated. A separate MWVSM monitor was attached to the forehead and finger of each patient. Data from each included pulse wave transit time (PWTT), temperature, HR, SpO2, and a summary status termed ""Murphy Factor"" (MF), which ranges from 0 to 5. Patients are classified as ""routine"" if MF = 0 to 1 or SI = 0 to 0.7, ""priority"" if MF = 2 to 3 or SI = 0.7 to 0.9, and ""critical"" if MF = 4 to 5 or SI >= 0.9. Forehead and finger MWVSM HRs both differed from the monitor (both p < 0.001), but the few beats per minute differences were clinically insignificant. Differences in MWVSM SpO2 (1-7%) and temperature (6-13degreeF) from the monitor were site specific (all p < 0.001). Forehead PWTT (271 +/- 50 ms) was less (p < 0.001) than finger PWTT (315 +/- 42 ms); both were dissociated from systolic blood pressure (r(2) < 0.05). The SI distributed patients about equally as ""routine,"" ""priority,"" and ""critical,"" whereas MF overtriaged to ""routine"" and undertriaged to ""critical"" for both sensors (all p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that MF does not accurately predict the most critical patients, likely because erroneous PWTT values confound MF calculations. MF and the MWVSM are promising, but require fine-tuning before deployment.

The eFUMI method models the problem of learning a heartbeat concept from a BCG signal as a MIL problem. This approach elegantly addresses the uncertainty inherent in a BCG signal (e. g., misalignment between training data and ground truth, mis-collection of heartbeat by some transducers, etc.). Given a BCG training signal coupled with a ground truth signal (e.g., a pulse finger sensor), training ""bags"" labeled with only binary labels denoting if a training bag contains a heartbeat signal or not can be generated. Then, using these bags, eFUMI learns a personalized concept of heartbeat for a subject as well as several non-heartbeat background concepts. After learning the heartbeat concept, heartbeat detection and heart rate estimation can be applied to test data. Experimental results show that the estimated heartbeat concept found by eFUMI is more representative and a more discriminative prototype of the heartbeat signals than those found by comparison MIL methods in the literature.",2016,2022-08-24T07:29:38Z,2022-08-24T07:29:38Z,NA,756-760,NA,NA,2016,NA,Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed17&NEWS=N&AN=617662954,*machine learning; uncertainty; human; *ballistocardiography; *heart rate; transducer,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Annual Conference,NA,1557-170X,10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591796,NA,"Hospital acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs) is a major problem that affects around one in twenty patients who are admitted in hospital with sudden illness. These ulcers often occur when patients have limited mobility and cannot change positions in bed on their own. Traditionally, the occurrence of HAPUs has been minimized by turning the patient every 2 hours to alternating lateral and supine positions, and by using pressure redistributing mattresses. In many healthcare facilities, such a patient repositioning schedule is not always maintained owing to low caregiver compliance to turning protocols. Difficulty in monitoring patient position continuously, lack of turn reminders/alerts and suboptimal caregiver staffing ratio increases the occurrence of HAPUs. A novel method to address the need for improved pressure ulcer prevention is presented. The proposed method consists of a wearable device which continuously monitors the patient's position and communicates wirelessly with a tablet which enables alerts to be sent to the caregiver when a patient turn is due in accordance with the protocol adopted by the hospital. The patient's position is continuously monitored and the turning procedure carried out is logged and updated on the hospital's cloud system, thereby enabling centralized monitoring.

However, advertent or inadvertent movement on part of the subject and different postures can affect the radar returned signal and also the accuracy of the estimated parameters from it. The detection and analysis of these postural changes can not only lead to improvement in estimation algorithms but also towards prevention of bed sores and ulcers in patients who require periodic posture changes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and nature of vital sign collection and clinical deterioration in emergency care., METHODS: A descriptive exploratory approach was used. Data were collected from the records of 200 randomly selected adults with presenting complaints of abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain and febrile illness from 1 January to 31 December 2014 at a 22 bed emergency department in Melbourne, Australia., RESULTS: When controlled for length of stay, heart rate was the most frequently assessed vital sign per hour (median=0.9) whilst Glasgow Coma Score was the least frequently assessed vital sign per hour (median=0.5). Clinical deterioration (one or more vital signs fulfilling hospital medical emergency team activation criteria during emergency department care) occurred in 14.5% of patients. Of the 5466 vital sign measures, 19.6% were abnormal, 1.9% indicated clinical deterioration., CONCLUSIONS: Clinical deterioration occurred in one in seven patients, and one in five vital signs documented were outside of accepted normal ranges.

The importance of screening and identification of ICU delirium has been identified in both adult and pediatric literature. Delirium increases ICU morbidity, length of mechanical ventilation and length of stay. The objective of this study was to determine the current knowledge level about delirium and its risk factors among pediatric critical care nurses through a short questionnaire. We hypothesized that before a targeted educational intervention, PICU care providers do not have an adequate knowledge base for accurate screening and diagnosis of delirium in critically ill children. A 17 question online survey was given to all nurses in a tertiary 36-bed PICU to assess current knowledge about delirium in children. The response rate was 73% (105/143). When asked to identify the correct way to diagnose pediatric delirium, 11.4% of nurses surveyed (12/105) incorrectly believed that Glasgow Coma Score is the appropriate screening tool. A large proportion of respondents (40/105) believed that benzodiazepines are helpful in treatment of delirium. The results of the survey identified specific knowledge gaps about risk factors and treatment of pediatric delirium in the critically ill child. There is a critical need for education about pediatric delirium and its risk factors among PICU staff prior to unit-wide implementation of a delirium screening and prevention program, specifically with regards to screening methods and pharmacologic risk factors. These results are likely generalizable to all physicians, nurses and staff who care for critically ill children. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Experiments were carried out in spouted beds with three different cone angles (30degree, 45degree, 60degree) and high density spherical particles (Pp=6050kg/m3) with diameters of 0.5 or 1mm. Different hydrodynamic structures in the movement of solids were identified by examining pressure fluctuations of the bed in the frequency domain. Peaks in the power spectral density of pressure fluctuations were observed corresponding to movement of bulk of solids (low frequency, less than 5Hz), particle transport in the spout (medium frequency, between 5 and 15Hz) and clustering and motion of clusters throughout the bed (high frequency, between 15 and 130Hz). Axial movement of solids and pulsation motion of spout peripheries each exhibits a distinct peak in the medium frequency zone. It was shown by the frequency domain analysis of pressure fluctuations that solids are more mobile in annulus of a bed of smaller diameter particles and there is more effective lateral solid transfer from the annulus to the spout when the cone angle is smaller.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2015,2022-08-24T07:29:39Z,2022-08-24T07:29:39Z,NA,392-400,NA,"(Mostoufi) School of Chemical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, P.O.

For over 50 years, pressure mapping and subjective comfort has been the primary indicators for mattress selection. Our research demonstrates that mattress/patient interface pressure and relative blood/oxygen perfusion do not inversely correlate and pressure is not a meaningful, real-time indicator of tissue ischemia and risk of pressure ulcer development. Developed in our research is a real-time sensor system to simultaneously measure and record these parameters over the anatomical sites at risk for PUs. Measurements focused on the heel, sacrum, trochanter, ischium, scapula and occipital. A modified pressure mapping system is used for interface pressure measurements and integrated with multiple near-infrared sensors to measure specific deep tissue hemoglobin saturated oxygen or rSO2. Testing and mattress design development was done during the period of 2008 to present. Over 200 human tests of commercially available mattresses were conducted in supine, 30 degree, and 70 degree positions, ranging in times of up to four hours. During this time period, we utilized 20 test subjects-eight female and 12 male-with ages ranging from 18 to 65 years. The result of this proprietary off-loading device evaluation and design system shows that the new Oxy-MatTM (Off-Loading Technologies, Tarrytown, NY) Non-Powered Mattress System consistently provides optimized tissue perfusion as measured by natural deep tissue oxygen saturation levels. In extensive laboratory and clinical evaluations, the Oxy-MatTM was shown to be functionally superior to CMS Group 2 powered mattresses. Another outcome of our research was that a powered mattress system may not be appropriate for most sensate and semi-ambulatory patients.

Reliable diagnosis supported by precise wound evaluation is crucial in order to success on treatment decisions. This paper presents a computer-vision approach to wound-area detection based on statistical colour models. Starting with a training set consisting of 113 real wound images, colour histogram models are created for four different tissue types. Back-projections of colour pixels on those histogram models are used, from a Bayesian perspective, to get an estimate of the posterior probability of a pixel to belong to any of those tissue classes. Performance measures obtained from contingency tables based on a gold standard of segmented images supplied by experts have been used for model selection. The resulting fitted model has been validated on a training set consisting of 322 wound images manually segmented and labelled by expert clinicians. The final fitted segmentation model shows robustness and gives high mean performance rates [(AUC:.9426 (SD.0563); accuracy:.8777 (SD.0799); F-score: 0.7389 (SD.1550); Cohen's kappa:.6585 (SD.1787)] when segmenting significant wound areas that include healing tissues.Copyright © 2015, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.",2015,2022-08-24T07:29:39Z,2022-08-24T07:29:39Z,NA,345-359,NA,4,53,NA,Med.

Its evaluation relies on self-report; hence, the risk of being overlooked when verbal communication is impaired. Observation scales incorporating respiratory and behavioral signs (respiratory distress observation scales [RDOS]) can provide surrogates of dyspnea self-report in similar clinical contexts (palliative care). Method(s): The authors prospectively studied (single center, 16-bed ICU, large university hospital) 220 communicating ICU patients (derivation cohort, 120 patients; separate validation cohort, 100 patients). Dyspnea was assessed by dyspnea visual analog scale (D-VAS) and RDOS calculated from its eight components (heart rate, respiratory rate, nonpurposeful movements, neck muscle use during inspiration, abdominal paradox, end-expiratory grunting, nasal flaring, and facial expression of fear). An iterative principal component analysis and partial least square regression process aimed at identifying an optimized D-VAS correlate (intensive care RDOS [IC-RDOS]). Result(s): In the derivation cohort, RDOS significantly correlated with D-VAS (r = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.58). A five-item IC-RDOS (heart rate, neck muscle use during inspiration, abdominal paradox, facial expression of fear, and supplemental oxygen) significantly better correlated with D-VAS (r = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.72). The median area under the receiver operating curve of IC-RDOS to predict D-VAS was 0.83 (interquartile range, 0.81 to 0.84). An IC-RDOS of 2.4 predicted D-VAS of 4 or greater with equal sensitivity and specificity (72%); an IC-RDOS of 6.3 predicted D-VAS of 4 or greater with 100% specificity. Similar results were found in the validation cohort. Conclusion(s): Combinations of observable signs correlate with dyspnea in communicating ICU patients. Future studies in noncommunicating patients will be needed to determine the responsiveness to therapeutic interventions and clinical usefulness.Copyright © 2015, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.",2015,2022-08-24T07:29:39Z,2022-08-24T07:29:39Z,NA,830-837,NA,4,123,NA,Anesthesiology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States Publisher: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins (E-mail: LRorders@phl.lrpub.com),NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed16&NEWS=N&AN=606080521,facial expression; human; priority journal; adult; female; major clinical study; male; aged; fear; sensitivity and specificity; principal component analysis; conference paper; diagnostic test accuracy study; heart rate; intensive care unit; breathing rate; mean arterial pressure; visual analog scale; *dyspnea; *diagnostic accuracy; *distress syndrome/di [Diagnosis]; *distress syndrome/th [Therapy]; neck muscle; oxygen therapy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our data reveal a rich diversity of proteins that are dynamically modulated, and we selectively highlight a family of calcium binding proteins (S-100 molecules) including calcyclin (S100-A6), calgranulins A (S100-A8) and B (S100-A9), and calgizzarin (S100-A11). IMS allowed us to target three discrete regions of interest: the wound bed, adjacent dermis, and hypertrophic epidermis. Plots derived using unsupervised principal component analysis of the global protein signatures within these three spatial niches indicate that these data from wound signatures have potential as a prognostic tool since they appear to delineate wounds that are favorably responding to therapeutic interventions versus those that remain stagnant or intractable in their healing status. Our discovery-based approach with IMS augments current knowledge of the molecular signatures within pressure ulcers while providing a rationale for a focused examination of the role of calcium modulators within the context of impaired wound healing.Copyright © 2015 American Chemical Society.",2015,2022-08-24T07:29:39Z,2022-08-24T07:29:39Z,NA,986-996,NA,2,14,NA,J.

They provide more comfort to the patient when integrated in everyday objects (e.g., beds or seats) for long-term monitoring. However, the application of capacitive sensors is limited by their high sensitivity to motion artifacts. For example, motion at the body-electrode interface causes variations of the coupling capacitance which, in the presence of a dc voltage across the coupling capacitor, create strong artifacts in the measurements. The origin, relevance, and reduction of this specific and important type of artifacts are studied here. An injection signal is exploited to track the variations of the coupling capacitance in real time. This information is then used by an identification scheme to estimate the artifacts and subtract them from the measurements. The method was evaluated in simulations, lab environments, and in a real-life recording on an adult's chest. For the type of artifact under study, a strong artifact reduction ranging from 40 dB for simulated data to 9 dB for a given real-life recording was achieved. The proposed method is automated, does not require any knowledge about the measurement system parameters, and provides an online estimate for the dc voltage across the coupling capacitor.Copyright © 1964-2012 IEEE.",2015,2022-08-24T07:29:40Z,2022-08-24T07:29:40Z,NA,264-273,NA,1,62,NA,IEEE Trans.

For older adults who are living at home or in nursing homes, the bed is an integral part of their daily lives. Telemonitoring of physical activities in bed can provide valuable information of the status of an older adult. This paper presents a Bed-Centered Telehealth System (BCTS), which uses the bed as the center of health data collection for telehealth systems implemented in homes and nursing homes. Methods The core sensor of the BCTS is a soft motion-sensing mattress, WhizPAD, which collects signals of physical activities in bed that can be classified into events such as on/off bed, sleep posture, movement counts, and respiration rate. Results Integrated with information and communication systems, caregivers can maintain awareness of older adults' daily activities and needs by using their mobile devices to access the BCTS for real-time monitoring and historical data record of bed-related activities, as well as receiving service reminders and alerts for abnormal events. Scenarios of using the BCTS in the homes and nursing homes are described. Conclusion The design concept of BCTS is to integrate telehealth functions into something that already exists in the home, namely the bed. Future extensions of the BCTS to include other telemonitoring functions are discussed.Copyright © 2014, Asia Pacific League of Clinical Gerontology & Geriatrics. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC.

The objective was to examine the associations between sleep characteristics (duration, efficiency, bedtime) and dietary intake patterns in a sample of Canadian children. Material(s) and Method(s): Data for this study were obtained from the International Study of Childhood Obesity, Lifestyle and the Environment (ISCOLE). This analysis includes data on children aged 9-11 years from Ottawa, Canada (n = 507, 41.2% boys). Sleep duration (hours/day), sleep efficiency (%) and bedtime (h:min) were assessed over 7 days using actigraphy. Dietary intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire, asking participants how often they consumed 23 food items in a usual week. Principal component analyses were conducted to create two dietary scores: ""unhealthy diet"" (e.g. hamburgers, soft drinks, fried food), and ""healthy diet"" (e.g. vegetables and fruits). Multivariable linear regression was used to investigate the associations between sleep characteristics and dietary intake patterns of children. Result(s): Children averaged 9.1 hours of sleep per night with 96.2% sleep efficiency and a mean bedtime of 21:35. In unadjusted models, poor sleep efficiency was associated with a worse score for unhealthy diet (r = -0.17, p < 0.01) and later bedtime was associated with a worse score for healthy diet (r = -0.15, p < 0.01). After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, annual household income, body mass index z-score and physical activity level, relationships between sleep efficiency and unhealthy diet (r = -0.11, p = 0.02), and bedtime and healthy diet (r = -0.11, p = 0.02) remained significant. No associations were found with the other variables. Conclusion(s): Later bedtimes and poor sleep efficiency, but not sleep duration, were associated with poor dietary patterns in our sample.

Two studies have used sensory testing to examine subgroups in cohorts with mixed pain disorders, including participants with low back pain. Findings from these studies suggest heterogeneous sensory characteristics may exist in people with low back pain. However, these studies were small, examined a limited battery of sensory modalities, and lacked examination of between-cluster differences across a range of biopsychosocial factors that may influence pain sensitivity. To date, no studies have attempted to determine the existence of subgroups with different sensory characteristics, within a large cohort of people with axial chronic low back pain, using multimodal sensory testing, and probabilistic, unsupervised cluster analysis. Purpose(s): To explore the existence of subgroups, with heterogeneous sensory characteristics using standardised psychophysical tests, in a large cohort with axial chronic low back pain using latent class analysis, and to profile subgroups according to demographic, psychosocial, lifestyle, and general health factors. Method(s): Cross-sectional study involving 294 people with axial chronic low back pain. Psychophysical tests included standardised measures of nociceptive and non-nociceptive multimodal sensory function: ""bedside"" quantitative sensory testing (two-point discrimination, vibration detection, pinprick hyperalgesia, enhanced temporal summation to mechanical stimulation) and laboratory quantitative sensory testing (mechanical detection threshold, pressure, heat and cold pain thresholds, conditioned pain modulation). Identified subgroups were profiled on age, sex, body mass index, pain intensity, low back pain related disability, depression, anxiety, stress, life events, fear avoidance beliefs, catastrophising, back pain-specific perceptual dysfunction, comorbidities, widespread pain, sleep quality and activity levels. Latent class analysis, a probabilistic method of cluster analysis, was used to determine the existence and number of clusters using scores from principal component analysis as indicators. Between-cluster differences in sensory testing results and profiling variables were examined using linear regression, analysis of variance or chi-squared analysis. Result(s): A three cluster model was estimated as optimal by latent class analysis with sensory characteristics as follows: Cluster 1 - average to high temperature and pressure sensitivity; Cluster 2 - average to high pressure sensitivity; Cluster 3 - low temperature and pressure sensitivity. Profiling of clusters identified Cluster 3 as having lower levels of depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance. Conclusion(s): People with chronic axial low back pain can be subgrouped based on responses to multimodal sensory testing. Profiling of these subgroups revealed higher levels of depression and sleep disturbance in two subgroups, which is consistent with previous research showing these factors are related to pain sensitivity. Implications: Subgroups characterised by different sensory characteristics do exist in people with chronic axial low back pain. Better characterising these subgroups in combination with demographic, psychosocial, lifestyle, and general health factors may help to inform more specifically tailored interventions.",2015,2022-08-24T07:29:40Z,2022-08-24T07:29:40Z,NA,eS1246-eS1247,NA,SUPPL. 1,101,NA,Physiotherapy,NA,World Confederation for Physical Therapy Congress 2015.

In our prior work, we characterized it and discovered a finite number of distinct risk trajectory types. In this study we seek to predict these types in advance of the onset of overt CRI. Method(s): From a 24 bed step-down unit, continuous vital sign (VS) data were collected over 3mo for heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 1/20Hz, and intermittently recorded systolic (SysBP) and diastolic (DiaBP) blood pressure. CRI alerts were identified through an expert panel, followed by constructing a data set with 158 patients with CRI and 79 without. Trajectory analysis yielded 5 statistically distinct CRI risk evolution groups (persistently high [HIGH], persistently low [LOW], early-onset [EARLY], late onset [LATE], transient risk [TR]). For each patient, we extracted numeric features from 1hr of VS time series and trained Random Forest models to predict their CRI risk group at 1, 2, ... up to 30min before overt CRI onset. Result(s): The 10-fold cross-validated Area Under Receiver Operating Curve (AUC) showed varied temporal predictive trends. For the HIGH group, AUC is constantly high at 87% (SD 1%), for the LOW group it starts at 76% at 30min and steadily increases to 88% at 1min before CRI. For the EARLY group, the AUC starts at 65%, and steadily increases to 85% at 10min before CRI. For the remaining LATE and TR groups, it starts low at 65% and rises slightly to 70% by 15min before CRI. Conclusion(s): Predictive modeling identifies patients in the HIGH and LOW CRI risk trajectory groups even at 30min lead time with high confidence. While discrimination for other groups varied with lead time, they all showed improved predictive value as they approached onset of CRI. This insight can be used in building robust predictive algorithms that consider heterogeneity and dynamic properties of CRI risk evolution reflected in the patient monitoring data.",2015,2022-08-24T07:29:40Z,2022-08-24T07:29:40Z,NA,207,NA,12 SUPPL. 1,43,NA,Crit.

Evaluation and treatment are restricted due to high costs and limited availability of clinical sleep facilities. The need to close the gap between the needs and the solutions stimulates new technological developments to allow simple sleep self-evaluation, and possibly adequate help, in the personal sleep environment. Large scale solutions using mobile communication and off the shelf sensors provide initial sleep assistance. At the same time, sleep data acquisition facilitates better understanding of the sleep process itself and continuous improvement of the initial technologies. SleepRate application offers users sleep evaluation and personalized sleep improvement using a smartphone, Heart Rate fitness monitors, and computerized CBTI techniques. Following is what the good and poor sleepers teach us. Method(s): Over 9000 users and 20,000 tracked nights between January 23rd and December 12th 2014. Most used the system freely for nightly evaluation (FG), 330 engaged in sleep assessment and improvement (EG). All provided nightly information and or measurements. The engaged group provided also their sleep concerns and answered questionnaires. Result(s): EG only: age 37.9 (SD 16.6), 61% males, concerned about: trouble falling asleep (41%), nighttime awakenings (58%), snoring (45%), early awakenings (50%), difficulties to get up (60%), not being rested upon wake up (86%), sleepiness during the day (74%), learning about their sleep (97%). Detailed data regarding 792 assessment nights and 1108 free measurement nights after November 2nd indicate significant difference between FG and EG (t-test, p < 0.001). (1) Measured variables: TST (FG 403 min)/(EG 386 min); WASO (FG 47 min)/(EG 53 min); Mean Sympatho-Vagal Balance (FG 1744)/(EG 22.45 min); Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) duration (FG 114 min/EG 102 min); Sleep latency 20 min in both groups. (2) Reported nightly diary: Total time in bed (FG 467 min)/(EG 457 min); Sleep latency (FG 18 min/EG 27 min); WASO (FG 18 min)/(EG 36 min); Sleep Efficiency (FG 92%/EG 85%); Daytime Sleepiness (FG 25/EG 31). Similar go to bed time (23:00 pm) and wake up time (6:30 am). Users with sleep complaints overestimate their fall asleep time. Conclusion(s): People sleep less than 7 hours, those engaged in assessment report more sleep difficulties and sleep about a quarter of an hour less than the free measurement group. They also have as a group less SWS and a higher nightly sympatho-vagal balance, indicating hyperarousal.

Sleep apnea testing is increasingly done at home to reduce cost and capture sleep characteristics in a natural living environment. We investigated whether LC sensors could detect sleep apnea at home when compared to a Type III home apnea test (HAT). Method(s): Data was collected from LC sensors deployed under the supports of 8 subjects' beds in their own homes for a minimum of 6 nights. HAT was performed for one to two nights. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was visually scored for each HAT following American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines. Each night of LC data was processed with a machine learning algorithm developed in our lab to create an estimate of AHI (AHI-LC) utilizing only the load cell data. Result(s): Average AHI and AHI-LC values were 13.82 and 14.84, respectively. The root-mean-squared error across all subjects was 6.46 apneas per hour. Using a cutoff AHI of 5, 7 out of the 8 subjects were correctly diagnosed as being positive or negative for sleep apnea when averaging across all nights of in-home AHI-LC data. Six subjects were correctly identified as having sleep apnea using the average AHI-LC, and 1 subject was correctly classified as not having sleep apnea. One misclassified subject had mild sleep apnea, but AHI-LC > 5 for only 1 of 7 nights (average AHI-LC = 2.13). Conclusion(s): This data demonstrates that load cells can be used within subjects' own homes to detect sleep apnea over multiple nights. More research is needed to improve deployment for different bed types. This application might improve apnea testing by avoiding sleep disruption from sensors and providing assessment of many nights without patient interaction or contact with sensors.",2015,2022-08-24T07:29:40Z,2022-08-24T07:29:40Z,NA,A171,NA,SUPPL. 1,38,NA,NA,NA,"29th Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC, SLEEP 2015.

Snore sound analysis is not currently used in diagnosing OSA, but if successful, can provide a convenient way to screen and monitor the disease. In this paper we propose mathematical algorithms and graphical software tools to analyse snoring sounds as well as breathing to screen OSA. Our techniques can use bedside microphones (including smartphones) requiring no physical contact with a patient. The analysis is fully automated. Method(s): Breathing sounds were recorded with a bedside microphone (RODE, Model NT3) from 91 subjects (56 males and 35 females) undergoing routine Type-1 polysomnography. Snore sounds were automatically identified using a mathematical algorithm and mathematical features of snores were computed. We then trained a machine classifier to diagnose OSA, considering polysomnography-based clinical diagnosis as the reference standard. We trained two models, one each for males and females, and evaluated the performance using a 10-fold cross validation technique. We also developed alternative technology that does not require identifying snore sounds and can operate on sound streams including breathing sounds acquired with a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy). We developed a software tool complete with a graphical user interface to analyse sounds. Result(s): When RDI =15 was used as the OSA diagnosis threshold, the proposed technique achieved a sensitivity of 98%) at a specificity of 91% in the male group. Corresponding numbers for the female group was 94% and 95%. At the threshold RDI = 30, we obtained a sensitivity of 94% (specificity: 91%) for males and a sensitivity of 100% (specificity: 96%) for females. Accuracy of the automated snore detection algorithm was 88% (sensitivity = 84%; specificity = 92%). Conclusion(s): Snore sound analysis holds potential as a tool for population screening of OSA in an unattended environment. Sounds can be acquired from bedside microphones, including smartphones.

Few studies have examined actigraphy-assessed sleep in relation to subclinical CVD. Moreover, poor sleep, particularly sleep continuity, is common during the menopausal transition, a time of accelerated CVD risk for women. We hypothesized that lower sleep efficiency and shorter sleep time would be associated with greater subclinical CVD among midlife women transitioning through the menopause. Method(s): 174 nonsmoking peri- and postmenopausal women ages 40-60 without a history of heart disease; not taking hormone therapy, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, insulin or SSRI/SNRI antidepressants; and not nightshift workers were studied. Women underwent a carotid ultrasound to assess carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and plaque, three days of wrist actigraphy to quantify sleep, a blood draw, psychosocial questionnaires, physical measures and 24 hours of physiologic monitoring to quantify vasomotor symptoms. Relations between sleep efficiency (percentage of time in bed sleeping, inverse transformed) or total sleep time and IMT or plaque (any/none) were tested in linear or logistic regression models controlling for age, race, education, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, lipids, the homeostatic model assessment, sleep and antihypertensive medications, sleep apnea, depressive symptoms and sleep vasomotor symptoms. Result(s): Women were on average 54 years old, with a sleep efficiency of 84%, a sleep time of 6 hours, and IMT of .68mm. 73% of the sample was non-Hispanic White and 45% had plaque. More inefficient sleep was significantly associated with higher IMT [beta, b (standard error, SE) =.04(.02), p=0.03, Figure]. More inefficient sleep was also associated with a somewhat greater likelihood of plaque [OR=2.40, 95%CI=1.00-5.89, p=.05], and a sleep time of <6 hours was associated with somewhat higher IMT [b(SE)=.04 (.02),p=.05; relative to >=7hours] in multivariable models. Conclusion(s): Poorer sleep continuity and to a lesser extent short sleep time is associated with greater subclinical CVD during the menopause transition. Interventions to improve sleep and their cardiovascular impact should be investigated during this important time of life.

The onset of this pattern is highly individual in time ranging from 10 min to 2 hours prior to reaching pH < 7.00. We hypothesized that fetuses have individual cardiovascular phenotype with regard to responses to rising acidemia with intermittent hypoxia, which would be reflected in individual temporal structure of FHR variability (fHRV) measure root mean square of successive differences of R-R intervals (RMSSD), a sensitive measure of vagal modulation of fHRV, which is known to increase with worsening acidemia. METHOD(S): No reliable mathematical tools existed to address this challenge. We developed a novel statistical approach to this problem and validated it in 27 physiological recordings mimicking human labour by inducing intermittent UCO of increasing frequency (Frasch et al, AJOG 2009) or severity (Wang et al, PLoS One 2014) in near-term fetal sheep. The algorithm uses continuous RMSSD to predict the temporal event when consistent hypotensive BP pattern emerges in an individual fetus. RMSSD was computed over 5 minute intervals for approx. 6 hours of each complete experiment and required 2.5 hours training time during baseline and mild UCO periods. This is similar to other machine learning methods. We then extracted change point information from the fluctuations in RMSSD time series to predict the individual hypotensive BP response. RESULT(S): Our findings validated the hypothesis that the new algorithm can identify individual time points of BP responses to UCO with worsening acidemia. In the 26 out of 27 cases, the algorithm matched the expert prediction (Wang et al, PLoS One 2014) detecting the hypotensive BP response 17+/-36 min before its visible onset from RMSSD time series. In one case, the algorithm failed due to multiple artefacts in HRV signal. CONCLUSION(S): The novelty of the current work is that it permits individualized statistical-level predictions about pathological changes in BP that endanger fetal brain from RMSSD (which can be acquired in human fetus non-invasively). This method can be deployed online as bedside FHR monitoring for earlier prediction of incipient severe fetal acidemia.",2015,2022-08-24T07:29:40Z,2022-08-24T07:29:40Z,NA,269A-270A,NA,SUPPL. 1,22,NA,Reprod.

Annual Conference,NA,1557-170X,10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319366,NA,"Sleeping is a crucial part of our circadian rhythm and the quality of sleep has substantial impact on the quality of life in general and the overall well-being of a person. That is why sleep related physiological measurements have been in the focus of many scientific studies along the years, and why a large number of different measurement methods have been developed for this purpose. The ability to monitor heart rate respiration without any sensors or electrodes being directly attached to the body is extremely useful especially in long-term monitoring and it allows automated daily measurements without any medical staff present. This is the reason why ballistocardiographic force sensors and accelerometers have been introduced alongside electrocardiography (ECG) and thermistors or respiration belts as a means to monitor the heart rate and respiration during sleep. While ECG remains as the most reliable and accurate method for heart rate monitoring, the development of unobtrusive monitoring methods has improved to the point where the commercialization of such sleep monitoring systems has been possible. In this paper, the signals of five sensors and sensor placement combinations for measuring physiological parameters from a sleeping person are evaluated and compared in terms of their measurement sensitivities and waveform quality.

The method was validated with overnight recordings from 46 subjects in varying setups (sleep clinic, home, single bed, double bed, two sensor types). The mean beat-to-beat interval error was 13 ms and on an average 54% of the beat-to-beat intervals were detected.

Two parsers were developed: a regular expression parser for extracting numeric concepts and a NLP based tree parser for extracting textual concepts. Concepts were further organized into i2b2 ontologies based on document structures and in-domain knowledge., RESULTS: 26,550 concepts were extracted with 99% being textual concepts. 1.01 million facts were extracted from sleep study documents such as demographic information, sleep study lab results, medications, procedures, diagnoses, among others.

Such systems aim to extract respiratory signals from time-series pressure sequences. However, variance of movements, such as unpredictable extremities activities, affect the quality of the extracted respiratory signals. BreathSens, a high-density pressure sensing system made of e-Textile, profiles the underbody pressure distribution and localizes torso area based on the high-resolution pressure images.

We describe here very long (>60 s) central apnea events (VLAs) with bradycardia and desaturation, discovered using a computerized detection system applied to our database of over 100 infant years of electronic signals. Eighty-six VLAs occurred in 29 out of 335 VLBW infants. Eighteen of the 29 infants had a clinical event or condition possibly related to the VLA. Most VLAs occurred while infants were on nasal continuous positive airway pressure, supplemental oxygen, and caffeine. Apnea alarms on the bedside monitor activated in 66% of events, on average 28 s after cessation of breathing. Bradycardia alarms activated late, on average 64 s after cessation of breathing. Before VLAs oxygen saturation was unusually high, and during VLAs oxygen saturation and heart rate fell unusually slowly. We give measures of the relative severity of VLAs and theoretical calculations that describe the rate of decrease of oxygen saturation. A clinical conclusion is that very long apnea (VLA) events with bradycardia and desaturation are not rare. Apnea alarms failed to activate for about one-third of VLAs. It appears that neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) personnel respond quickly to bradycardia alarms but not consistently to apnea alarms. We speculate that more reliable apnea detection systems would improve patient safety in the NICU. A physiological conclusion is that the slow decrease of oxygen saturation is consistent with a physiological model based on assumed high values of initial oxygen saturation.

The primary objective of this paper was to focus on neck and body behaviour during rotational motion, rather than linear motion which has been often associated with car collisions. This paper takes the current motion signal processing technique a step further by computing the differential between head and body motion. Neck electromyogram (EMG) and angular velocity data of the head and body were acquired simultaneously from 20 subjects, as they were rotated 45 degrees in the forward pitch plane, with and without visual input, in a motion simulator. The centre of rotation (COR) on the simulator was located behind the subject Results showed that neck muscle behaviour was affected by the forward rotations, as well as visual input. Anterior neck muscles were most active during forward rotations and trials including VR. Maximum effective muscle power and activity of 10.54% and 55.72 (mV/mV).s were reached respectively.

Moreover, the benefit of using multichannel systems as opposed to a single sensor is investigated. While it might seem intuitive that multiple channels are superior to a single channel, the main challenge lies in finding suitable methods to actually leverage this potential. To this end, two algorithms for heart rate estimation from multichannel vibration signals are presented and compared against a single-channel sensing solution. The first method operates by analyzing the cepstrum computed from the average spectra of the individual channels, while the second method applies Bayesian fusion to three interval estimators, such as the autocorrelation, which are applied to each channel. This evaluation is based on 28 night-long sleep lab recordings during which an eight-channel polyvinylidene fluoride-based sensor array was used to acquire cardiac vibration signals. The recruited patients suffered from different sleep disorders of varying severity. From the sensor array data, a virtual single-channel signal was also derived for comparison by averaging the channels. The single-channel results achieved a beat-to-beat interval error of 2.2% with a coverage (i.e., percentage of the recording which could be analyzed) of 68.7%. In comparison, the best multichannel results attained a mean error and coverage of 1.0% and 81.0%, respectively. These results present statistically significant improvements of both metrics over the single-channel results (p < 0.05).",2015,2022-08-24T07:29:41Z,2022-08-24T07:29:41Z,NA,227-235,NA,1,19,NA,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed16&NEWS=N&AN=609292343,polysomnography; human; female; male; aged; middle aged; sensitivity and specificity; reproducibility; devices; heart rate; *algorithm; *physiology; bed; *signal processing; *procedures; *pressure transducer; computer assisted diagnosis; mechanocardiography,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Motion correction was performed by restoring projection consistency using data from the motion tracking system, and reconstructing with an iterative fully 3D algorithm. Motion correction accuracy was evaluated by comparing reconstructed images with a stationary reference scan. We also investigated the effects on accuracy of tracker sampling rate, measurement jitter, interpolation of tracker measurements, and the synchronization of motion data and CT projections. After optimization of these aspects, motion corrected images corresponded remarkably closely to images of the stationary phantom with correlation and similarity coefficients both above 0.9. We performed a simulation study using volunteer head motion and found similarly that our method is capable of compensating effectively for realistic human head movements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical demonstration of generalized rigid motion correction in helical CT. Its clinical value, which we have yet to explore, may be significant. For example it could reduce the necessity for repeat scans and resource-intensive anesthetic and sedation procedures in patient groups prone to motion, such as young children. It is not only applicable to dedicated CT imaging, but also to hybrid PET/CT and SPECT/CT, where it could also ensure an accurate CT image for lesion localization and attenuation correction of the functional image data.",2015,2022-08-24T07:29:41Z,2022-08-24T07:29:41Z,NA,2047-2073,NA,5,60,NA,Phys Med Biol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United Kingdom,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed16&NEWS=N&AN=607857097,quality control; algorithm; human; procedures; adult; male; automated pattern recognition; head; artifact; image quality; brain; *head movement; computer assisted diagnosis; *computer simulation; *radiography; spiral computer assisted tomography,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Several features extracted from respiratory effort signal have succeeded in automated sleep stage classification throughout the night such as variability of respiratory frequency, spectral powers in different frequency bands, respiratory regularity and self-similarity. In regard to the respiratory amplitude, it has been found that the respiratory depth is more irregular and the tidal volume is smaller during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep than during non-REM (NREM) sleep. However, these physiological properties have not been explicitly elaborated for sleep stage classification. By analyzing the respiratory effort amplitude, we propose a set of 12 novel features that should reflect respiratory depth and volume, respectively. They are expected to help classify sleep stages. Experiments were conducted with a data set of 48 sleepers using a linear discriminant (LD) classifier and classification performance was evaluated by overall accuracy and Cohen's Kappa coefficient of agreement. Cross validations (10-fold) show that adding the new features into the existing feature set achieved significantly improved results in classifying wake, REM sleep, light sleep and deep sleep (Kappa of 0.38 and accuracy of 63.8%) and in classifying wake, REM sleep and NREM sleep (Kappa of 0.45 and accuracy of 76.2%). In particular, the incorporation of these new features can help improve deep sleep detection to more extent (with a Kappa coefficient increasing from 0.33 to 0.43). We also revealed that calibrating the respiratory effort signals by means of body movements and performing subject-specific feature normalization can ultimately yield enhanced classification performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014,2022-08-24T07:29:41Z,2022-08-24T07:29:41Z,NA,197-205,NA,1,14,NA,Biomed.

To address these unmet healthcare needs, especially for the early prediction and treatment of major diseases, health informatics, which deals with the acquisition, transmission, processing, storage, retrieval, and use of health information, has emerged as an active area of interdisciplinary research. In particular, acquisition of health-related information by unobtrusive sensing and wearable technologies is considered as a cornerstone in health informatics. Sensors can be weaved or integrated into clothing, accessories, and the living environment, such that health information can be acquired seamlessly and pervasively in daily living. Sensors can even be designed as stick-on electronic tattoos or directly printed onto human skin to enable long-term health monitoring. This paper aims to provide an overview of four emerging unobtrusive and wearable technologies, which are essential to the realization of pervasive health information acquisition, including: 1) unobtrusive sensing methods, 2) smart textile technology, 3) flexible-stretchable-printable electronics, and 4) sensor fusion, and then to identify some future directions of research. © 1964-2012 IEEE.",2014,2022-08-24T07:29:41Z,2022-08-24T07:29:41Z,NA,1538-1554,NA,5,61,NA,IEEE Trans.

It also provides a technique to remotely monitor patients in a non-intrusive manner. An existing fall detection algorithm is currently generating fall alerts in several rooms in the University of Missouri Hospital (MUH). In this paper we describe a technique to reduce false alerts such as pillows falling off the bed or equipment movement. We do so by detecting the presence of the patient in the bed for the times when the fall alert is generated.

Specifically, bed positioning and a patient's related mobility in that bed can have a profound impact on risks such as pneumonias, blood clots, bed ulcers and falls. This issue has been exacerbated as the nurse-per-bed (NPB) ratio has decreased in recent years. To help assess these risks, it is critical to monitor a hospital bed's positional status (BPS). Two bed positional statuses, bed height (BH) and bed chair angle (BCA), are of critical interests for bed monitoring.

Current vital sign-based risk scores for ward patients have demonstrated limited accuracy, which leads to missed opportunities to identify those patients most likely to suffer cardiac arrest and inefficient resource utilization. We derived and validated a prediction model for cardiac arrest while treating ICU transfer as a competing risk using electronic health record data. Design(s): A retrospective cohort study. Setting(s): An academic medical center in the United States with approximately 500 inpatient beds. Patient(s): Adult patients hospitalized from November 2008 until August 2011 who had documented ward vital signs. Intervention(s): None. Measurements and Main Results: Vital sign, demographic, location, and laboratory data were extracted from the electronic health record and investigated as potential predictor variables. A person-time multinomial logistic regression model was used to simultaneously predict cardiac arrest and ICU transfer. The prediction model was compared to the VitalPAC Early Warning Score using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and was validated using three-fold cross-validation. A total of 56,649 controls, 109 cardiac arrest patients, and 2,543 ICU transfers were included. The derived model more accurately detected cardiac arrest (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.88 vs 0.78; p < 0.001) and ICU transfer (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.77 vs 0.73; p < 0.001) than the VitalPAC Early Warning Score, and accuracy was similar with cross-validation. At a specificity of 93%, our model had a higher sensitivity than the VitalPAC Early Warning Score for cardiac arrest patients (65% vs 41%). Conclusion(s): We developed and validated a prediction tool for ward patients that can simultaneously predict the risk of cardiac arrest and ICU transfer. Our model was more accurate than the VitalPAC Early Warning Score and could be implemented in the electronic health record to alert caregivers with real-time information regarding patient deterioration. © 2013 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",2014,2022-08-24T07:29:42Z,2022-08-24T07:29:42Z,NA,841-848,NA,4,42,NA,Crit.

To study the Zolpidem arousing effect in persistent vegetative state (PVS) patients combining clinical evaluation, autonomic assessment by heart rate variability (HRV), and EEG records. Methods. We studied a group of 8 PVS patients and other 8 healthy control subjects, matched by age and gender. The patients and controls received drug or placebo in two experimental sessions, separated by 10-14 days. The first 30 minutes of the session were considered the basal record, and then Zolpidem was administered. All participants were evaluated clinically, by EEG, and by HRV during the basal record, and for 90 minutes after drug intake. Results. We found in all patients, time-related arousing signs after Zolpidem intake: behavioral (yawns and hiccups), activation of EEG cortical activity, and a vagolytic chronotropic effect without a significant increment of the vasomotor sympathetic tone. Conclusions. We demonstrated time-related arousing signs after Zolpidem intake. We discussed possible mechanisms to explain these patho-physiological findings regarding EEG cortical activation and an autonomic vagolytic drug effect. As this autonomic imbalance might induce cardiocirculatory complications, which we didn't find in any of our patients, we suggest developing future trials under control of physiological indices by bedside monitoring. However, considering that this arousing Zolpidem effect might be certainly related to brain function improvement, it should be particularly considered for the development of new neuro-rehabilitation programs in PVS cases. According to the literature review, we claim that this is the first report about the vagolitic effect of Zolpidem in PVS cases. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.",2014,2022-08-24T07:29:42Z,2022-08-24T07:29:42Z,NA,4185-4202,NA,26,20,NA,Curr.

This is because the positive predictive value (PPV) of fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring, the mainstay of fetal health surveillance during labour, to detect concerning fetal acidemia is around 50%. In fetal sheep model of human labour, we reported that severe fetal acidemia (pH,7.00) during repetitive umbilical cord occlusions (UCOs) is preceded ,60 minutes by the synchronization of electroencephalogram (EEG) and FHR. However, EEG and FHR are cyclic and noisy, and although the synchronization might be visually evident, it is challenging to detect automatically, a necessary condition for bedside utility. Here we present and validate a novel non-parametric statistical method to detect fetal acidemia during labour by using EEG and FHR. The underlying algorithm handles non-stationary and noisy data by recording number of abnormal episodes in both EEG and FHR. A logistic regression is then deployed to test whether these episodes are significantly related to each other. We then apply the method in a prospective study of human labour using fetal sheep model (n = 20). Our results render a PPV of 68% for detecting impending severe fetal acidemia, 60 min prior to pH drop to less than 7.00 with 100% negative predictive value. We conclude that this method has a great potential to improve PPV for detection of fetal acidemia when it is implemented at the bedside. We outline directions for further refinement of the algorithm that will be achieved by analyzing larger data sets acquired in prospective human pilot studies.

An algorithm server analyzes the data on different temporal scales to derive sleep behaviors such as daily sleep quality and daily sleep stage, and various derivatives such as daily life style change, monthly biorhythmic change, and seasonal health dynamics. These outcomes are expected to further link to health conditions through in-depth analysis, and serve to early warning of disease development.Copyright © 2014, Japan Soc. of Med.

ICU admitted patients are at high risk of dyspnea, and of not being able to describe it using a mere visual analog scale (VAS). This study assessed the respiratory distress observation scale (RDOS), a hetero-evaluation dyspnea scale validated in palliative care, in ""day one"" ICU patients. Methods. In 193 patients admitted to a 16-bed ICU (4 months), we recorded dyspnea, anxiety and pain VAS, RDOS components (breathing frequency, heart rate, accessory muscle activity, nasal flaring, abdominal paradox, expiratory grunting, restlessness, frightened look), various physiological data and disease and treatment descriptors. VAS and RDOS were compared using Spearman's correlation. RDOS ability to detect a VAS>3 was studied using ROC curves. A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted with the aim of developing a ICU-RDOS. Results. VAS proved impossible in 73 patients. In the remaining 120, RDOS was moderately correlated with VAS (rho=0.45, 95%CI 0.29-0.58, p<0,01) (Figure). RDOS>3 had a 95.5% specificity (95%CI 87.5-99.1) to predict VAS>3. In PCA, two vectors explained 36.2% of the data set variability. F1 (25.9%) included breathing frequency, accessory muscle activity, nasal flaring, and a frightened look. F2 (10.3%) included abdominal paradox, restlessness, a frightened look, and breathing frequency. It proved possible to improve the performance of RDOS both in terms of correlation with EVA (rho = 0.612) and area under ROC curve by selecting a subset of the RDOS descriptors and adding new physiogical variables (heart rate, respiratory admission, paradoxical breathing, accessory muscle activity, frightened look). Conclusion. It seems possible to identify ICU patients higly likely to suffer from dyspnea from hetero-observed signs. This might improve dyspnea management in this setting.

Better approaches for artifact filtering are required, but the task of classifying events as artifacts vs. real alerts is complex, requiring sophisticated algorithms acting on real-time data. Creating a bank of correctly labeled annotations of events as real or artifact to develop these algorithms is essential, but requires considerable expert input. We propose using active learning, a semi-supervised machine learning approach that dynamically learns from experience and iteratively selects small numbers of VS events for expert annotation, to eventually achieve testset performance comparable to using a large number of expert-annotated events upfront, thereby reducing expert effort. Method(s): We recruited 314 admissions to a 24-bed stepdown unit, recording 18,314 hrs of noninvasive VS monitoring data at 1/20Hz frequency for continuous peripheral pulse oximetry (SpO2), heart rate, and respiratory rate; noninvasive blood pressure (BP) measured every 2h. SpO2 events (<85%; n=219) were visually adjudicated and annotated by two experts (MRP, MH) as artifact (14%) or real. BP events (systolic BP<80 or >200 mmHg, diastolic BP>110 mmHg; n=96) were similarly annotated (37.5% artifact). We simulated an active learning system using expert-annotated SpO2 and BP data as ground truth. First, the system attempts building a logistic regression model with a fraction of expert-annotated data points (e.g. 10%). It then proposes a list of events to be annotated, based on classification uncertainty. Once feedback is received (ground truth label supplied), it proposes the next batch of events but meanwhile the model updates. We tracked model performance at each stage on hold-out data. Result(s): Our active learning approach performance is reported as ability to correctly adjudicate events (by ROC curve in a 10-fold cross validation setup) vs. percentage of expert-annotated data used in the process. Optimal model performance for SpO2 (AUC 77%) was reached using 30% of the expert-annotated data, while optimal BP performance (AUC 90%) was achieved using 50% of the data. When only 10% of the expert-annotated data were used for SpO2 or BP events, each model achieved 80% of the eventual optimal performance. Conclusion(s): An active learning method can reduce the amount of data needing human expert annotation when classifying monitoring events as artifact vs. real, although classification is more difficult for SpO2. Nevertheless, further refinements of such algorithms hold promise to classify incoming monitoring data and inform clinical actions.

We examined SWA-topography following sleep restriction, associations with myelination and reaction time in children. Method(s): High-density EEG was recorded in 13 healthy children (5-12 years, 7 m) during habitual sleep (HS) and restricted sleep (RS, 50% of HS, delayed bedtime). A topographic analysis of SWA was performed (first 60 min NREM sleep). Myelin-water-fraction (MWF) maps were determined (mcDESPOT-MRI, normalization to custom pediatric templates, Gaussian kernel smoothing). Before and after sleep, reaction time was measured in an auditory oddball task. Result(s): RS led to an overall SWA increase, which was most pronounced in 3 regions (2 prefrontal, PF; 1 parieto-occipital, PO). The SWA increase in PO was negatively associated with MWF in the optic radiation (partial r = -0.57, P < 0.05). Moreover, the SWA increase in PF correlated with an overnight reaction time decrease (HS, r = -0.79 P < 0.05; partial r = -0.81 P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Unlike the adult-typical frontal SWA increase after sleep deprivation, parieto-occipital and prefrontal SWA was enhanced in children, which may be driven by anatomical substrates. Moreover, overnight performance changes may benefit from a more 'frontalized' SWA-response to RS. Similar to recent animal studies, our results suggest that maturing brain circuits in children are vulnerable to sleep loss. Chronic inadequate sleep throughout childhood may be a risk factor for the development of mental health disorders.",2014,2022-08-24T07:29:43Z,2022-08-24T07:29:43Z,NA,5,NA,SUPPL. 1,23,NA,J.

Annotation of large amounts of clinical data consumes valuable time of expert clinicians. We propose to determine whether active learning (AL) can be used to reduce expert effort. Method(s): Noninvasive vital signs monitoring data from 8 week admissions in a 24-bed step-down unit (heart rate [HR], respiratory rate [RR; bioimpedance], oscillometric blood pressure [BP], peripheral oximetry [SpO2]) recorded at 20s intervals included 585 episodes of persisting SpO2 instability (SpO2>85%). A committee of experts adjudicated the initial batch (201) of these alerts labeling them as true instabilities (133), artifacts (39) or unclear (29), used to train a Random Forest (RF) classifier to label alerts as true or artifact. AL was used to select still unlabeled episodes that, when labeled by humans, would improve the classifier the most. We used a method derived from (Fiterau, Dubrawski: Projection Retrieval for Classification, NIPS 2012) to select data that maximizes the expected information gain and presents it in a human-interpretable fashion, and compared it against a RF classifier that selects the most uncertain data. At the conclusion of each of the 3 cycles of expert adjudication (yielding 37, 43, 33 annotated cases respectively), we measured the number of still unlabeled data that cannot be confidently adjudicated by the respective models. Result(s): Informative AL method was not able to adjudicate 114 cases at the end of the 1st cycle, but at the end of 2nd it could confidently process all unlabeled data saving experts from having to label 304 episodes at that point (52% effort reduction), while RF method would allow 11% effort reduction at the end of cycle 3. Conclusion(s): Informative AL is useful in reducing data annotation efforts by expert clinicians.

Despite its importance, patients' mobility is not routinely measured, due, in part, to the burden of manual measurement. Method(s): To create a Non-Invasive Mobility Sensor (NIMS) to measure patients' mobility, 3 Microsoft Kinect cameras were deployed in a single adult ICU room at Johns Hopkins Hospital. 362 hours of color and depth (RGBD) image data were collected. The NIMS was developed using the following two steps. First, a state-of-the-art Computer Vision (CV) algorithm was implemented to automatically track the location and pose (e.g. lying, sitting or standing) of the patient. Second, using these tracking results over fixed 10-minute time periods, a decision tree combined the location and pose information to automatically classify the highest level of mobility achieved over that period into a simplified 6-category ICU mobility scale: lying in bed, passively moved to chair, sitting over edge of bed, standing, transferring bed to chair with standing, and walking. To validate NIMS, we manually reviewed and coded 33 randomly sampled 10-minute video segments using the simplified ICU mobility scale. The weighted Kappa (kappa) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used to measure agreement between NIMS and the manually coded categories. Result(s): NIMS achieved a kappascore of 0.90 (CI: 0.81, 0.98) which is significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than a classifier which randomly assigned each segment into 1 of the 6 mobility categories. NIMS achieved a kappascore of 1.00 for the mobility categories of lying, sitting and walking. The kappascore was lowered in video segments where the patients' pose changed greatly (e.g., from sitting to standing) with kappa= 0.63 (CI: 0.43, 0.83) due, primarily, to errors in the tracking algorithm that is not robust to large variations in the pose. Conclusion(s): A highly accurate NIMS for automating measurement of patient mobility is feasible using RGBD sensors and CV technologies. A refined tracking algorithm robust to large variations in patient pose will further improve accuracy for mobility classification.",2014,2022-08-24T07:29:43Z,2022-08-24T07:29:43Z,NA,A1389,NA,12 SUPPL. 1,42,NA,Crit.

We used Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithms, trained on expertlabeled data, to automatically classify events as real alerts or artifact in continuous vital sign (VS) data from bedside monitors. Our purpose was to determine if RF differentiated real alerts from artifact in previously unseen monitoring data to a clinically helpful degree. Method(s): Noninvasive monitoring data from 8 weeks of admissions in a 24-bed step-down unit (heart rate [HR], respiratory rate [RR; bioimpedance], oscillometric blood pressure [BP], peripheral oximetry [SpO2]) were recorded at 1/20Hz. VS deviation beyond stability thresholds (HR 40-140, RR 8-36, systolic BP 80-200, diastolic BP<110, SpO2>85%) and persisting for 80% of a 5 min moving window comprised events. Of 1,582 events, 631 were labeled by consensus of four expert clinicians as real alerts, artifact, or unable to classify (UTC), and the remaining 795 held as unseen. Using the 631 labeled events, RF was trained to tell apart real alerts from artifact, then cross-validated to mitigate overfitting. Next the resulting model was applied to the 795 unseen events, which were then reviewed by the experts for external validation of RF predictions. Result(s): 418 alerts were labeled by experts as real alerts (SpO2 44%, RR 32%, BP 11%, HR 14%), 158 as artifact (SpO2 59%, RR16%, BP25%, HR0%), and 55 UTC. For the 795 unseen events, of 510 RR events, experts agreed with 100% of the RF artifact predictions, and 99% of real alert predictions (UTC=1%). Of 55 BP events, the agreement was 80% and 76% (UTC=0%). Of 230 SpO2 events, there was 55% artifact agreement (UTC=10%) and 92% real alert agreement (UTC=3%). Conclusion(s): A RF model trained on a small set of expert-labeled data was able to discriminate real alerts from artifact in monitored RR and BP data to a clinically helpful degree. SpO2 artifact was the most difficult to discriminate.

Background(s): Cognitive deficits are known to contribute significantly to the occurrence of falls in PD, but prospective studies have yielded conflicting results concerning which specific bedside cognitive tests most accurately predict fall risk. We examined this relationship using a variety of cognitive measures in a prospective falls study of 36 PD patients. Method(s): This is a convenience sample of 36 subjects with idiopathic PD using data from a vitamin D intervention study to compare fall rates to various cognitive measures. Cognitive testing included tests of global function (MOCA), memory (WMS-III Logical Memory), executive (trails A & B, Stroop, WAIS-III letter-number sequencing, digit symbol), visual spatial (JoLo), attention (Stroop, WAIS-R digit span forwards and backwards), and language (Boston naming, verbal fluency f's, animals, vegetables). Result(s): Evaluation of potential confounders including age, gender, PD duration, years of education, and PD severity from the Hoehn & Yahr score revealed only age as being predictive of future falls (p=0.049). Of the 18 cognitive function assessments, prediction of future falls showed significant associations or non-significant trends with Trails Making (p=0.080), Forward Digit Span total (p=0.073) and span (p=0.048), Digit Symbol score (p=0.049), Letter Number Sequence testing (p=0.085), Judgment of Line Orientation (p=0.088), and the Boston Naming Task (p=0.079). Collinearity among the cognitive measures was accounted for by principal component analysis which identified 5 primary components from the original 18 measures. Of the five, one component, primarily driven by Digit Span, MOCA score and Letter Number Sequencing, showed a trend to predict future falling (p=0.078). Conclusion(s): The collection of significant associations is suggestive of an underlying relationship between cognitive function with future falls, even after accounting for collinearity among the neuropsych assessments. Although many of the associations were either marginal or simply trends, the results suggest an issue with power that could be easily remedied with a larger sample size.

Changes in the LLFDI BLE score can be used to guide treatment decisions. The purpose of this study was to examine the factor structure of 12-month change in LLFDI BLE scores in an observational study of mobility of older adults. Method(s): Community-dwelling older adults (n=85) participated in an observational study of mobility. LLFDI BLE scores were obtained at baseline and 12 months and change scores were calculated. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the change scores of the14 items of the LLFDI BLE using principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Result(s): Change in LLFDI BLE item scores loaded onto 5 factors with Eigenvalues >1 and explained 63.1% of the variance in change scores. The factors (variance explained) included strength (15.2 %); bending ( 12.5%) ; endurance (12.5%); limits of stability (12.4%); and complex tasks (10.5%). Sample items and loadings (r) on each factor included: strength, stepping on and off a bus (r=.755); bending, make a bed (r=.806 ); endurance, up and down stairs (r= .793 ); limits of stability, reach over head (r =.612); complex tasks, move chair in order to clean (r= .791 ). Conclusion(s): The LLFDI BLE is often used to assess overall change in ability to perform common standing and walking tasks, but it is less often analyzed by item to determine the specific kinds of changes that occur.

Comparisons of the specimen to extant and fossil cercopithecoid tibiae using threedimensional geometric morphometrics allow inferences about its locomotor behavior and taxonomic affiliation. Thirty-nine landmarks were recorded on the proximal and distal articular surfaces and midshaft of EP 1100/12, and on 119 tibiae of extant cercopithecids using an Immersion 3D Microscribe. Landmarks were subjected to generalized Procrustes analysis and principal components analysis. The first principal components from analyses of proximal and distal landmarks explained approximately 30% of the variation and captured differences in the width and angularity of the articular surfaces. From these results, discriminant function analyses were run with reference to taxonomic and locomotor classifications of extant primates. Proportions of quadrupedal, climbing, leaping, suspensory, and arboreal locomotor behaviors were collected from the literature for each extant taxon. Discriminant function analyses of these proportions indicate that the fossil is most similar to the tibiae of highly arboreal cercopithecids, particularly those that employ quadrupedal, climbing, and leaping locomotor behaviors. Analyses of taxonomic affinity found that the morphology of EP 1100/12 was closest to tibiae of the extant colobines, Nasalis and Procolobus. Based on these results, and overall size of the fossil tibia, EP 1100/12 is best attributed to the fossil colobine, Rhinocolobus sp., which is known from cranio-dental and other postcranial remains at Laetoli.",2014,2022-08-24T07:29:43Z,2022-08-24T07:29:43Z,NA,163-164,NA,SUPPL. 58,153,NA,Am.

Capacitive sensors present an attractive option for pervasively monitoring neonatal ECG, and can be embedded in a support system or even a garment worn by the neonate. This could improve comfort and reduce pain aiding better recovery as well as avoiding the scars caused by adhesive electrodes. In this work, we investigate the use of an array of capacitive sensors unobtrusively embedded in a mattress and used in a clinical environment for 15 preterm neonates. We also describe the analysis framework including the fusion of information from all sensors to provide a more accurate ECG signal. We propose a channel selection strategy as well as a method using physiological information to obtain a reliable ECG signal. When sensor coverage is well attained, results for both instantaneous heart rate and ECG signal shape analysis are very encouraging. The study also provides several insights on important factors affecting the results.

The two recording methods have been compared in terms of signal quality and differences in heart beat detection., RESULTS: On average, coverage of 92.7% of the total sleep time was obtained for the bed sensor, testifying the good quality of the recordings. The average beat-to-beat error of the inter-beat intervals was 1.06%. These results suggest a good overall signal quality, however, considering fast heart rates (HR > 100 bpm), performances were worse: in fact, the sensitivity in the heart beat detection was 28.4% while the false positive rate was 3.8% which means that a large amount of fast beats were not detected., CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of the measurements made using the bed sensor has less than 10% of failure rate especially in periods with HR lower than 70 bpm. For fast heart beats the uncertainty increases. This can be explained by the change in morphology of the bed sensor signal in correspondence of a higher HR.",2014,2022-08-24T07:29:43Z,2022-08-24T07:29:43Z,NA,308-313,NA,4,53,NA,Methods Inf Med,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Germany,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed15&NEWS=N&AN=612303403,polysomnography; reproducibility; signal processing; circadian rhythm; heart rate; ballistocardiography; *physiology; *bed; ambulatory electrocardiography; *devices; *equipment design,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Detecting falls soon after they occur can be potentially live saving. In addition, early treatment of fall-related injuries can reduce treatment costs by minimizing health deterioration resulting from long periods spent incapacitated on the floor after a fall (a scenario known as a `long lie') and decreasing the number of hospital bed-days required. In this study, a previously proposed unobtrusive nighttime fall detection system based on wireless passive infrared sensors and furniture load sensors is evaluated in a pilot study involving three older subjects, monitored for a combined total of 174 days.

Continuous recording of working heart rate and random observations of nursing activities were applied to collect data from eight nurses during two consecutive 12h day shifts. Using descriptive statistics and random-effect analysis of variance, the contributions of individual nursing work activities to acute fatigue were compared based on the activity frequencies and nurses' corresponding heart rate elevations. Of 860 observed nursing-related work activities, manual patient-handling, bedside-care, care-coordinating, and walking/standing activities accounted for 5%, 16%, 38%, and 41%, respectively. After controlling for the differences of participant and shift, the percentage of working heart rate to maximal heart rate of manual patient-handling (64.3%), bedside-care (59.7%), and walking/standing (57.4%) activities were significantly higher than that of care-coordinating activities (52.3%, F[3, 38.0] =7.5, P<0.001).

The audio data is captured using low end Android Smartphones in a non-clinical environment to mimic a possible user-friendly commercial product for sleep audio monitoring. However snore detection becomes a more challenging problem as the recorded signal has lower quality compared to those recorded in clinical environment. To have an accurate classification of snore/non-snore, we first compare a range of commonly used features extracted from the audio signal to find the best subject-independent features. Thereafter, bio-motion data is used to further improve the classification accuracy by identifying episodes which contain high amounts of body movements. High body movement indicates that the subject is turning, coughing or leaving the bed; during these instances snoring does not occur. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using the data recorded over 25 sessions from 7 healthy subjects who are suspected to be regular snorers. Our experimental results showed that the best subject-independent features for snore/non-snore classification are the energy of frequency band 3150-3650 Hz, zero crossing rate and 1st predictor coefficient of linear predictive coding. The proposed features yielded an average classification accuracy of 84.35%. The introduction of bio-motion data significantly improved the results by an average of 5.87% (p<;0.01).

However, using several identical or physically different sensors, redundancy can be used to decrease the error in noncontact heart rate estimation, while increasing the time period during which reliable data are available. In this paper, we show for the first time two major results in case of contactless heart rate measurements deduced from a capacitive ECG and optical pulse signals. First, an artifact detection is an essential preprocessing step to allow a reliable fusion. Second, the robust but computationally efficient median already provides good results; however, using a Bayesian approach, and a short time estimation of the variance, best results in terms of difference to reference heart rate and temporal coverage can be achieved.

Chinese journal of pediatrics,NA,0578-1310,NA,NA,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of the pulse indicator continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) system in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)., METHOD: Two cases of SAP with ARDS were monitored using PiCCO during comprehensive management in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University. To guide fluid management, the cardiac index (CI) was measured to assess cardiac function, the global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI) was used to evaluate cardiac preload, and the extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) was used to evaluate the pulmonary edema., RESULT: Case 1 was diagnosed with type L2 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (intermediate risk) and received the sixth maintenance phases of chemotherapy this time. After a 1-week dosage of chemotherapeutic drugs (pegaspargase and mitoxantrone), he suffered SAP combined with ARDS. Except comprehensive treatment (life supporting, antibiotic, etc.) and applying continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) to remove inflammatory mediators. PiCCO monitor was utilized to guide fluid management. During the early stage of PiCCO monitoring, the patient showed no significant manifestations of pulmonary edema in the bedside chest X-ray (bedside ultrasound showed left pleural effusion), and had an oxygenation index 223 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa), GEDVI 450 ml/m2, and ELVWI 7 ml/kg. We increased cardiac output to increase tissue perfusion and dehydration speed of CVVHDF was set at 70 ml/h. Two hours later, GEDVI significantly increased to 600 ml/m2 and ELVWI significantly increased to 10 ml/kg, the oxygenation index declined to 155 mmHg, the bedside chest X-ray showed a significant decrease of permeability (right lung) and PEEP was adjusted to 5 cmH2O (1 cmH2O = 0.098 kPa), indicating circulating overload. ARDS subsequently occurred, upon which the fluid infusion was halted, the dehydration rate of CVVHDF raised (adjusted to 100-200 ml/h). On day 3 in the PICU, EVLWI dropped to 6 ml/kg, GEDVI dropped to 370 ml/m2, and the oxygenation index increased to 180 mmHg. On day 8, the patient was successfully weaned from the ventilator. However, on day 9, the patient reverted to mechanical ventilation due to secondary infection. On day 30, the patient was discharged for voluntarily giving up treatment. Late follow-up results showed that the patient was dead one day after giving up treatment. Case 2 was admitted due to SAP induced by overeating one day before admission. On day 2, the patient showed dyspnea and oxygen saturation decreased to 80%. We applied mechanical ventilation, CVVHDF to remove inflammatory mediators and PiCCO to guide fluid management. According to the initial data of PiCCO, EVLWI was 9 ml/kg, GEDVI was 519 ml/m2, the oxygenation index was 298 mmHg, the bedside chest X-ray showed decreased permeability and PEEP was adjusted to 5 cmH2O, suggesting the existence of ARDS. During treatment, the dehydration speed of CVVHDF was set at 50 ml/h to maintain the balance of fluid input and output. Two hours after PiCCO monitoring, the oxygenation index decreased to 140 mmHg, GEDVI 481 ml/m2, EVLWI 9 ml/kg, thus the dehydration speed of CVVHDF was increased (up to 100 ml/h). On day 4 in the PICU, EVLWI was 9 ml/kg, GEDVI was 430 ml/m2, oxygenation index was 394 mmHg, and the bedside chest X-ray showed that permeability was higher. On day 5, the patient was transferred from PiCCO. On day 30, the patient recovered and was discharged., CONCLUSION: PiCCO monitoring can provide real-time surveillance of cardiac function, cardiac preload and afterload, and extravascular lung water in pediatric patients with SAP combined with ARDS.

Positioning of patients is an essential component of pressure ulcer prevention because it off-loads areas of high pressure. However, the effectiveness of such positioning is debatable. A continuous bedside pressure mapping (CBPM) device can provide real-time feedback of optimal body position though a pressuresensing mat that displays pressure images at a patient's bedside, allowing off-loading of high-pressure areas and possibly preventing HAPU formation. Methods A prospective controlled study was designed to determine if CBPM would reduce the number of HAPUs in patients treated in our medical intensive care unit. In 2 months, 422 patients were enrolled and assigned to beds equipped with or without a CBPM device. Patients' skin was assessed daily and weekly to determine the presence and progress of HAPUs. All patients were turned every 2 hours. CBPM patients were repositioned to off-load high-pressure points during turning, according to a graphic display. The number of newly formed HAPUs was the primary outcome measured. Achi2 test was then used to compare the occurrence of HAPUs between groups. Results HAPUs developed in 2 of 213 patients in the CBPM group (0.9%; both stage II) compared with 10 of 209 in the control group (4.8%; all stage II; P =.02). Conclusion Significantly fewer HAPUs occurred in the CBPM group than the control group, indicating the effectiveness of real-time visual feedback in repositioning of patients to prevent the formation of new HAPUs. © 2014 American Association of Critical-Care Nurses.",2014,2022-08-24T07:29:44Z,2022-08-24T07:29:44Z,NA,127-133,NA,2,23,NA,Am.

A three-layer artificial neural network model was developed to simulate and predict an indentation curve of human spine, characterized with the depth of lumbar lordosis and four inclination angles: cervicothoracic, thoracolumbar, lumbosacral and the back-hip (beta). By comparing the spinal indentation curves described by the optimal evaluation parameters (depth of lumbar lordosis, cervicothoracic, thoracolumbar and lumbosacral), a better design of five-zone spring mattresses was obtained for individuals to have an effective support to the main part of the body. Using such approach, an operating process was further introduced, in which appropriate stiffness proportions were proposed to design mattress for the normal body types of Chinese young women. Finally, case studies were undertaken, which show that the method developed is feasible and practical.

These robots are capable of not only offering more frequent and more accessible therapies but also providing new insights into treatment effectiveness based on their ability to measure interaction parameters. A requirement for having more advanced therapies is to identify how robots can 'adapt' to each individual's needs at different stages of recovery. Hence, our research focused on developing an adaptive interface for the GENTLE/A rehabilitation system. The interface was based on a lead-lag performance model utilising the interaction between the human and the robot. The goal of the present study was to test the adaptability of the GENTLE/A system to the performance of the user. Point-to-point movements were executed using the HapticMaster (HM) robotic arm, the main component of the GENTLE/A rehabilitation system. The points were displayed as balls on the screen and some of the points also had a real object, providing a test-bed for the human-robot interaction (HRI) experiment. The HM was operated in various modes to test the adaptability of the GENTLE/A system based on the leading/lagging performance of the user. Thirty-two healthy participants took part in the experiment comprising of a training phase followed by the actual-performance phase. The leading or lagging role of the participant could be used successfully to adjust the duration required by that participant to execute point-to-point movements, in various modes of robot operation and under various conditions. The adaptability of the GENTLE/A system was clearly evident from the durations recorded. The regression results showed that the participants required lower execution times with the help from a real object when compared to just a virtual object. The 'reaching away' movements were longer to execute when compared to the 'returning towards' movements irrespective of the influence of the gravity on the direction of the movement. The GENTLE/A system was able to adapt so that the duration required to execute point-to-point movement was according to the leading or lagging performance of the user with respect to the robot. This adaptability could be useful in the clinical settings when stroke subjects interact with the system and could also serve as an assessment parameter across various interaction sessions. As the system adapts to user input, and as the task becomes easier through practice, the robot would auto-tune for more demanding and challenging interactions. The improvement in performance of the participants in an embedded environment when compared to a virtual environment also shows promise for clinical applicability, to be tested in due time. Studying the physiology of upper arm to understand the muscle groups involved, and their influence on various movements executed during this study forms a key part of our future work.",2013,2022-08-24T07:29:44Z,2022-08-24T07:29:44Z,NA,102,NA,"(Chemuturi) Adaptive Systems Research Group, Department of Computer Science, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane campus, Hatfield AL10 9AB, UK.",10,NA,J Neuroeng Rehabil,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed14&NEWS=N&AN=563078183,*artificial intelligence; article; human; adult; female; male; methodology; middle aged; young adult; arm; *robotics; *algorithm; adaptation; *cerebrovascular accident/rh [Rehabilitation]; *computer interface,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods In a prospective study, 32 healthy volunteers (16 male, 16 female) with a mean age of 23.9+/-3.3 years (20-39 years) were included. Before and after intravenous administration of 1,000 mg AZ (single dose), ocular microcirculation parameters were measured every 20 min for 2 h. Retinal vessel diameters (VD) were measured bythe retina vessel analyzer, blood flow (BF) in the neuroretinal rim by the laser doppler flowmeter according toRiva, and the parapapillary retinal BF by the scanning laser Doppler flowmeter. Additionally, the Langham ocular blood flow system was used to determine the ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) and the pulsatile ocular blood flow (pOBF). The measurements were correlated with systemic blood pressure (BP), ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), capillary base excess parameters and serum AZ levels. Results Arterial and venous VD were significantly increased by about 4-5 % each. Papillary BF increased significantly about 40 %. Parapapillary retinal flow dropped significantly about 19 % (120 min). OPA and pOBF showed no statistically significant changes. BP showed no significant changes, and OPP was significantly increased. There were no correlations with pH or systemic perfusion parameters. Conclusions AZ leads to a dilatation of retinal VD, to an increase of BF in the optic nerve head, and to a decrease of parapapillary retinal BF. The different BF changes in different vascular beds might be due to different regulatory mechanisms, steal effects, or different distributions of thecarbonic anhydrase. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",2013,2022-08-24T07:29:44Z,2022-08-24T07:29:44Z,NA,1389-1398,NA,5,251,NA,Graefe's Arch.

OBJECTIVE(S): To prospectively validate a predictive algorithm for clinical deterioration in general-medical ward patients, and to conduct a trial of real-time alerts based on this algorithm. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled crossover study. SETTING/PATIENTS: Academic center with patients hospitalized on 8 general wards between July 2007 and December 2011. INTERVENTIONS: Real-time alerts were generated by an algorithm designed to predict the need for ICU transfer using electronically available data. The alerts were sent by text page to the nurse manager on intervention wards. MEASUREMENTS: Intensive care unit transfer, hospital mortality, and hospital length of stay. RESULT(S): Patients meeting the alert threshold were at nearly 5.3-fold greater risk of ICU transfer (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.6-6.0) than those not satisfying the alert threshold (358 of 2353 [15.2%] vs 512 of 17678 [2.9%]). Patients with alerts were at 8.9-fold greater risk of death (95% CI: 7.4-10.7) than those without alerts (244 of 2353 [10.4%] vs 206 of 17678 [1.2%]). Among patients identified by the early warning system, there were no differences in the proportion of patients who were transferred to the ICU or who died in the intervention group as compared with the control group. CONCLUSION(S): Real-time alerts were highly specific for clinical deterioration resulting in ICU transfer and death, and were associated with longer hospital length of stay. However, an intervention notifying a nurse of the risk did not result in improvement in these outcomes. © 2013 Society of Hospital Medicine.",2013,2022-08-24T07:29:44Z,2022-08-24T07:29:44Z,NA,236-242,NA,5,8,NA,J.

Recent studies have demonstrated that frequent laboratory testing does not necessarily relate to better outcomes. Design(s): Data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification were performed and an artificial intelligence tool, fuzzy modeling, was used to identify lab tests that do not contribute an information gain. There were 11 input variables in total. Ten of these were derived from bedside monitor trends heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure, and urine collections, as well as infusion products and transfusions. The final input variable was a previous value from one of the eight lab tests being predicted: calcium, PTT, hematocrit, fibrinogen, lactate, platelets, INR and hemoglobin. The outcome for each test was a binary framework defining whether a test result contributed information gain or not. Patient(s): Predictive modeling was applied to recognize unnecessary lab tests in a real world ICU database extract comprising 746 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Main Result(s): Classification accuracy of necessary and unnecessary lab tests of greater than 80% was achieved for all eight lab tests. Sensitivity and specificity were satisfactory for all the outcomes. An average reduction of 50% of the lab tests was obtained. This is an improvement from previously reported similar studies with average performance 37% by [1-3]. Conclusion(s): Reducing frequent lab testing and the potential clinical and financial implications are an important issue in intensive care. In this work we present an artificial intelligence method to predict the benefit of proposed future laboratory tests. Using ICU data from 746 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, and eleven measurements, we demonstrate high accuracy in predicting the likely information to be gained from proposed future lab testing for eight common GI related lab tests. Future work will explore applications of this approach to a range of underlying medical conditions and laboratory tests. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",2013,2022-08-24T07:29:44Z,2022-08-24T07:29:44Z,NA,345-358,NA,5,82,NA,Int.

Design(s): Examination of ad libitum 24-hour ambulatory gross motor activity patterns. Setting(s): Communitydwelling, outpatient. Participant(s): Ninety-two individuals with AD, 35 of whom had apathy. Measurements: Wrist actigraphy data were collected and examined using functional principal component analysis (fPCA). Result(s): Individuals with apathy have a different pattern of gross motor activity than those without apathy (first fPCA component, p <0.0001, t = 5.73, df = 90, t test) such that there is a pronounced decline in early afternoon activity in those with apathy. This change in activity is independent of depression (p = 0.68, F[1, 89] = 0.05, analysis of variance). The decline in activity is consistent with an increase in napping. Those with apathy also have an early wake and bedtime (second fPCA component, t = 2.53, df = 90, p <0.05, t test).

Our study aimed to develop and validate a robust, high performance, and sensitive whole-night snore detector based on non-contact technology. Design(s): Sounds during polysomnography (PSG) were recorded using a directional condenser microphone placed 1 m above the bed. An AdaBoost classifier was trained and validated on manually labeled snoring and non-snoring acoustic events. Patient(s): Sixty-seven subjects (age 52.5+/-13.5 years, BMI 30.8+/-4.7 kg/m2, m/f 40/27) referred for PSG for obstructive sleep apnea diagnoses were prospectively and consecutively recruited. Twenty-five subjects were used for the design study; the validation study was blindly performed on the remaining forty-two subjects. Measurements and Results: To train the proposed sound detector, >76,600 acoustic episodes collected in the design study were manually classified by three scorers into snore and non-snore episodes (e.g., bedding noise, coughing, environmental). A feature selection process was applied to select the most discriminative features extracted from time and spectral domains. The average snore/non-snore detection rate (accuracy) for the design group was 98.4% based on a ten-fold cross-validation technique. When tested on the validation group, the average detection rate was 98.2% with sensitivity of 98.0% (snore as a snore) and specificity of 98.3% (noise as noise). Conclusion(s): Audio-based features extracted from time and spectral domains can accurately discriminate between snore and non-snore acoustic events. This audio analysis approach enables detection and analysis of snoring sounds from a full night in order to produce quantified measures for objective follow-up of patients. © 2013 Dafna et al.",2013,2022-08-24T07:29:45Z,2022-08-24T07:29:45Z,NA,e84139,NA,12,8,NA,PLoS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: United States Publisher: Public Library of Science (185 Berry Street, Suite 1300, San Francisco CA 94107, United States)",NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed14&NEWS=N&AN=372407323,polysomnography; sound; article; human; adult; female; major clinical study; male; controlled study; validation study; aged; very elderly; sensitivity and specificity; principal component analysis; prospective study; body mass; awareness; sleep disorder; noise; microphone; sleep disordered breathing/di [Diagnosis]; *snoring; sound detection,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The first example of predictive monitoring being taken from inception (proof of concept) to reality (demonstration of improved outcomes) is the use of heart rate characteristics (HRC) monitoring to detect sepsis in infants in the neonatal ICU. The commercially available 'HeRO' monitor analyzes electrocardiogram data from existing bedside monitors for decreased HR variability and transient decelerations associated with sepsis, and converts these changes into a score (the HRC index or HeRO score). This score is the fold increase in probability that a patient will have a clinical deterioration from sepsis within 24h. This review focuses on HRC monitoring and discusses future directions in predictive monitoring of ICU patients. RECENT FINDINGS: In a randomized trial of 3003 very low birthweight infants, display of the HeRO score reduced mortality more than 20%. Ongoing research aims to combine respiratory and HR analysis to optimize care of ICU patients. SUMMARY: Predictive monitoring has recently been shown to save lives. Harnessing and analyzing the vast amounts of physiologic data constantly displayed in ICU patients will lead to improved algorithms for early detection, prognosis, and therapy of critical illnesses. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",2013,2022-08-24T07:29:45Z,2022-08-24T07:29:45Z,NA,172-179,NA,2,25,NA,Curr.

Three identified time periods were compared: sepsis (""sick"") with positive blood culture, sepsis (""sick"") with negative blood culture, and control (""non-sick""). This model was significant in predicting positive sick and all sick with area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.775 (p < 0.001) and 0.714 (p < .001), respectively, up to 48 hours prior. Method(s): Analysis was performed using 11 clinical variables from an existing within-patient comparison database of 59 burn patients from a single center. Secondary analysis compared 4 groups: non-sick vs positive sick; non-sick vs negative sick; negative sick vs positive sick; and non-sick versus all sick. Modified-random forest and CART (Classification and Regression Tree) decision tree approaches were applied to the dataset. Limitations of data excluded 2 ""novel predictors"" from this analysis: glucose and BD. Result(s): Positive sick vs not sick was the only paring with AUROC > 0.7, significant only 24 hours prior. Classifiers that achieved target AUROC include: max temp > 39.4 OR max blood transfusion (BT) >=2 OR MAP < 58 = AUROC 0.737; MAP < 55 OR min BT >=2 = AUROC 0.728; and any 2 of max 24 hour urine < 299, MAP < 57, Temp < 36.2degreeC = AUROC 0.720. High HR and low MAP were important to discriminate any sick vs non-sick patient. Conclusion(s): Positive sick versus not sick is the dichotomy best predicted accurately overall. Elevated HR and low MAP have been further validated as strong predictors of burn sepsis. Ongoing prospective validation of clinical predictors continues at our burn center as decision support technology solutions are in development to incorporate best predictors into useful tools for bedside providers.",2013,2022-08-24T07:29:45Z,2022-08-24T07:29:45Z,NA,A57,NA,12 SUPPL. 1,41,NA,Crit.

The biological instability of the upper airway forma tion across the night, and especially during obstructive events, may lead to alterations in inter and intra snore properties. The lack of agreed approach to extract and analyze whole night snoring sounds is of major importance to the ield of sleep-disordered breathing. In the current study we developed and validated a snore analysis algorithm enabling estimation of apnea hypopnea index (AHI-EST) of adult subjects based solely on analysis of snoring signals acquired by a non-contact microphone. Method(s): University-afiliated sleep center and biomedical signal processing laboratory. Ninety subjects (age 53+/-13 years, BMI 31+/-5 kg/m2) referred for polysomnography (PSG) diagnosis of OSA were prospectively recruited. The system was trained on 60 subjects. Validation was blindly performed on the additional 30 consecutive subjects. Snore sounds were recorded using a directional condenser microphone placed 1 m above the bed. Acoustic features exploring intra- (melcepstability, pitch density) and inter- (running variance, apnea phase ratio, inter- event silence) snore properties were extracted and integrated to assess AHI-EST. Result(s): No signiicant differences were found between system design (m/f 36/24) and validation (m/f 21/9) groups in age, Body Mass Index, reporting snoring, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, AHI, associated morbidities, or tobacco smoking. AHI-EST was found to be correlated with AHI-PSG (study design: r = 0.9, p < 0.001; validation: r = 0.84, p < 0.001). The Bland Altman plots comparing AHI-PSG versus AHIEST showed no consistent bias, i.e., the mean difference was only 0.5 and 3.5 events/h for system design and validation, respectively. The plots also showed that the AHI-EST corresponded more closely to AHI-PSG when the mean AHI was <30 events/h in the validation study. Using the diagnostic agreement approach, we found 83% diagnostic agreement with PSG. Conclusion(s): Acoustic analysis based on intra- and inter-snore properties can differentiate subjects according to AHI.

The relationship between sleep quality and PA has not been adequately studied using objective measures. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of sleep quality on PA levels in adults with T2DM. Sleep and PA data were gathered using wrist actigraphy (Actiwatch ScoreTM), worn continuously for 7 days to measure physical movement. Subjects completed sleep diaries upon waking and just before bed. We used the Patient Reported Outcomes measurement information System (PROMIS) computerized adaptive testing modules for subjective sleep impairment and sleep disturbance measurement. Sociodemographic and physiological variables were also collected. Preliminary findings were drawn from a diverse sample (n=18, 50% African American, 72% female) of adults (age 57 + 4.9 yr) with T2DM. Baseline findings included A1c (7.6 + 2.3%), BMI (32.9 + 7.5 kg/m2). PROMIS sleep disturbance (52.8 + 7.3), & sleep impairment (53.6 + 9.6) was worse in the T2DM subjects than population norms for the same measures. We used hierarchical item cluster analyses & Forest data-mining to derive clusters of sleep variables that most affected PA (activity counts per minute, averaged daily during wake time). An emerging cluster of sleep variables, including higher self-reported sleep disturbance and impairment, objectively-measured poor sleep efficiency, and shorter sleep duration, were predictive of reduced daily activity. Additionally, partial dependence plots revealed that sleep duration of > 500 minutes and sleep efficiency > 90% were threshold levels for predicting significant increases in PA the following day, with no gain in PA beneath the threshold levels. These early findings are among the first to provide objective evidence in support of the role of poor sleep quality as a predictor of reduced PA in adults with T2DM.",2013,2022-08-24T07:29:45Z,2022-08-24T07:29:45Z,NA,A202,NA,SUPPL. 1,62,NA,Diabetes,NA,"73rd Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association.

In practice analysis of integrated multimodal physiologic data is either limited to what is available on a specific monitoring system or requires significant amounts of time and expertise if done in a batch analysis. We sought to demonstrate a flexible real-time application that could be generalized to any multimodality monitoring application. Methods Patient monitor and neuromonitoring data were acquired using Bedmaster EX. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) were ingested every 10 seconds by IBM Streams, a streaming analytic middleware platform. For cerebral autoregulation assessment, the pressure reactivity index (PRx) and a locally-weighted regression line characterizing the relationship between MAP and ICP were continuously computed. Patient state changes were approximated by calculating financial support and resistance lines for each signal. A web interface to visualize the results was created using javascript and W3C technologies. Results We have developed a demonstration real-time web application to enable clinicians to assess cerebral autoregulation status and identify potential patient state changes as they occur at the bedside. Most importantly, this infrastructure allows clinicians and quality control teams open access to raw data and the capacity to generate complex analytics using standard scientific development tools, including Matlab, R, or Python. Raw and processed data may be streamed simultaneously to bedside displays and long-term storage repositories. Conclusions We have demonstrated that real-time clinical analytics can be efficiently performed and displayed at the bedside.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) modulate gene expression and unique signatures have been identified in placental trophoblast at advanced gestations. We examined whether miRNA is differentially expressed in first trimester trophoblast of pregnancies destined to develop severe preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: 1st trimester trophoblast was prospectively collected from women undergoing CVS at 10-13 wks gestation for prenatal diagnosis. Samples were stored in RNAlater at -80 degreeC. Clinical information was obtained from designated patient questionnaires and medical records. SP was diagnosed by ACOG criteria. Singleton SP cases (n=5) and normal controls (n = 5) were matched for maternal age, ethnicity, parity, gestational age at CVS, and fetal sex (only females) and comorbidities were excluded. Each RNA sample was processed with the FlashTa Biotin HSR RNA Labeling Kit For Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA Arrays and were hybridized to GeneChip miRNA 3.0 Arrays. miRNA expression was normalized and then analyzed using Expression Console with RMA + DABG respectively. RESULT(S): Mean gestational age at delivery was 36.9wks (range 29.0 -40.0wks) and39.6wks (range37.4-40.4 wks) for SP and normal controls, respectively. Principal component analysis revealed that most of the molecular signatures are similar (Figure). Of the 1438 miRNAs analyzed, 576 were expressed in controls vs. 588 in SP. Supervised analysis of mi-RNA expression including a 2-way Wilcoxon T-Test showed that 24 miRNAs are significantly upregulated among SP vs controls, 5 with >1.5 fold change. Some of the upregulated mi-RNAs regulate matrix metallopro-teinases and genes for apoptosis, cellular movement and growth.

Annual Conference,NA,1557-170X,10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609757,NA,"A Pressure Bed Sensor (PBS) can offer an unobtrusive method for sleep monitoring. This study focuses on the detection of the sleep related breathing disorders using a PBS in comparison to the methods used in a sleep laboratory. A newly developed PCA modeling approach for the eight sensor signals of the PBS is evaluated using the Reduced Respiratory Amplitude Index (RRAI) as a central measure. The method computes the respiration amplitude with the Hilbert transform, and then detects the events based on a 20% amplitude reduction from the baseline signal. A similar calculation was used for the sleep laboratory RIP measurements, and both PBS and RIP were compared against the reference based on the nasal flow signal. In the reference RRAI method, the respiratory-disordered events were obtained using RemLogic respiration analyzer to detect over 50% amplitude reduction in the nasal respiratory flow, but removing the RemLogic standard hypopnea event associations on the oxygen desaturation events and the sleep arousals. The movement artifacts were automatically detected based on the movement activity signal of the PBS. Twenty-five (25) out of 28 patients were finally analysed. On average 87% of a night measurement has been covered by the system. The correlation coefficient was 0.92 between the PBS and the reference RRAI, and the performance of the PBS was similar with the RIP belts. Classifying the severity of the sleep related breathing by dividing RRAI in groups according to the severity criteria, the sensitivity was 92% and the specificity was 70% for the PBS. The results suggest that PBS recording can provide an easy and un-obstructive alternative method for the detection of the sleep disordered breathing and thus has a great promise for the home monitoring.",2013,2022-08-24T07:29:45Z,2022-08-24T07:29:45Z,NA,1342-1345,NA,NA,2013,NA,Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed14&NEWS=N&AN=605697328,physiologic monitoring; algorithm; human; female; male; middle aged; principal component analysis; devices; pathophysiology; heart rate; Sleep Apnea Syndromes/di [Diagnosis]; bed; breathing; REM sleep; *procedures; pressure; mechanocardiography,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

SETTING: This multicenter trial was performed in a variety of settings where chronic wounds are assessed. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 206 different photographs taken of 68 individuals with 95 chronic wounds of various etiologies were reviewed in this study. Wound etiologies included people with venous/arterial leg wounds (n = 13), diabetic foot wounds (n = 18), pressure ulcers (n = 32), and wounds of other etiologies (n = 5). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: An initial wound assessment using the revPWAT was performed at the bedside, and 3 digital photographs were takenV2 within 72 hours when no change had occurred, and a third was taken 3.5 to 6 weeks later. MAIN RESULTS: The revPWAT scores derived from photographs assessed by the same rater on different occasions and by different raters showed moderate to excellent intrarater intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) (ICC = 0.52Y0.93), as well as test-retest (ICC = 0.86Y0.90) and interrater (ICC = 0.71) reliability. There was excellent agreement between bedside assessments and assessments using photographs (ICC = 0.89). CONCLUSION(S): The revPWAT is a valid and reliable tool to assess chronic wounds of various etiologies where digital images are viewed.

However, performing SSC with unstable and/or ventilated VPIs remains challenging for caregiving teams and/or controversial in the literature. We first aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of SSC with vulnerable VPIs in a neonatal intensive care unit over 12 months. Our second aim was to evaluate the impact of the respiratory support (intubation or not) and of the infantEs weight (above or below 1000 g) on the effects of SSC. Vital signs, body temperature, and oxygen requirement data were prospectively recorded by each infantEs nurse before (baseline), during (3 time points), and after their first or first 2 SSC episodes. We compared the variations of each parameter from baseline (analysis of variance for repeated measures with post hoc analysis when appropriate). We studied 141 SSCs in 96 VPIs of 28 (24-33) weeks' gestational age, at 12 (0-55) days of postnatal age, and at a postmenstrual age of 30.5 (+/-1.5) weeks. During SSC, there were statistically significant increases in oxygen saturation (Sao2) (P < .001) with decreases in oxygen requirement (P = .043), a decrease in heart rate toward stability (P < .01) but a transient and moderate decrease in mean axillary temperature following the transfer from bed to mother (P < .05). Apneas/bradycardias requiring minor intervention occurred in 19 (13%) SSCs, without need for SSC termination. These variations were similar for intubated newborns (18%) as compared with newborns on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (52%) or breathing room air (30%). However, ventilated infants exhibited a significant increase in transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (TcPco2) (P = .01), although remaining in a clinically acceptable range, and a greater decrease in oxygen requirements during SSC (P < .001) than nonventilated infants. Skin-to-skin contact in the neonatal intensive care unit seems safe and effective even in ventilated VPIs. Recording physiologic data of infants before, during, and after SCC provides data needed to secure changes of practice in SCC. © 2013 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",2013,2022-08-24T07:29:45Z,2022-08-24T07:29:45Z,NA,255-262,NA,3,27,NA,J.

We aim to validate a novel machine learning (ML) score incorporating heart rate variability (HRV) for triage of critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department by comparing the area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity with the modified early warning score (MEWS). Method(s): We conducted a prospective observational study of critically ill patients (Patient Acuity Category Scale 1 and 2) in an emergency department of a tertiary hospital. At presentation, HRV parameters generated from a 5-minute electrocardiogram recording are incorporated with age and vital signs to generate the ML score for each patient. The patients are then followed up for outcomes of cardiac arrest or death. Result(s): From June 2006 to June 2008 we enrolled 925 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for ML scores in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours is 0.781, compared with 0.680 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.101, 95% confidence interval: 0.006 to 0.197). As for in-hospital death, the area under the curve for ML score is 0.741, compared with 0.693 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.048, 95% confidence interval: -0.023 to 0.119). A cutoff ML score >= 60 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 84.1%, specificity of 72.3% and negative predictive value of 98.8%. A cutoff MEWS >= 3 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 74.4%, specificity of 54.2% and negative predictive value of 97.8%. Conclusion(s): We found ML scores to be more accurate than the MEWS in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours. There is potential to develop bedside devices for risk stratification based on cardiac arrest prediction. © 2012 Ong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2012,2022-08-24T07:29:46Z,2022-08-24T07:29:46Z,NA,R108,NA,3,16,NA,Crit.

Design(s): Snore sounds were recorded using a directional condenser microphone placed 1 m above the bed. Acoustic features exploring intra-(melcepstability, pitch density) and inter-(running variance, apnea phase ratio, inter-event silence) snore properties were extracted and integrated to assess AHIEST. Setting(s): University-affiliated sleep-wake disorder center and biomedical signal processing laboratory. Patient(s): Ninety subjects (age 53 +/- 13 years, BMI 31 +/- 5 kg/m2) referred for polysomnography (PSG) diagnosis of OSA were prospectively and consecutively recruited. The system was trained and tested on 60 subjects. Validation was blindly performed on the additional 30 consecutive subjects. Measurements and Results: AHIEST correlated with AHI (AHIPSG; r2 = 0.81, P < 0.001). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 85% and 92% for thresholds of 10 and 20 events/h, respectively, were obtained for OSA detection. Both Altman-Bland analysis and diagnostic agreement criteria revealed 80% and 83% agreements of AHIEST with AHIPSG, respectively. Conclusion(s): Acoustic analysis based on intra- and inter-snore properties can differentiate subjects according to AHI. An acoustic-based screening system may address the growing needs for reliable OSA screening tool.

Optical interferometer is a sensitive device that detects physical changes of optical-fiber length due to external perturbations. When in direct or indirect contact with human body (e.g., hidden in a bed mattress), mechanical and acoustic activity of cardiac muscle and respiration reflect in the interferometric signal, enabling entirely unobtrusive monitoring of heartbeat and respiration. A novel, two-phased multimethod approach was developed for this purpose. The first phase selects best performing combinations of detection methods on a training set of signals. The second phase applies the selected methods to test set of signals and fuses all the detections of vital signs. The test set consisted of 14 subjects cycling an ergometer until reaching their submaximal heart rate. The following resting periods were analyzed showing high efficiency (98.18 +/- 1.40 sensitivity and 97.04 +/- 4.95 precision) and accuracy (mean absolute error of beat-to-beat intervals 22+/-9ms) for heartbeat detection, and acceptable efficiency (90.06 +/- 7.49 sensitivity and 94.21 +/- 3.70 precision) and accuracy (mean absolute error of intervals between respiration events 0.33 +/- 0.14s) for respiration detection. © 1964-2012 IEEE.",2012,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,NA,2922-2929,NA,10,59,NA,IEEE Trans.

We seek to find optimal parameters for tangential beams to cover the whole ipsilateral breast (WB) and minimize the dose to the organs at risk (OARs). Method(s): A support vector machine (SVM) based method is proposed to determine the optimal posterior plane of the tangential beams. Relative significances of including/avoiding the volumes of interests are incorporated into the cost function of the SVM. After finding the optimal 3-D plane that separates the whole breast (WB) and the included clinical target volumes (CTVs) from the OARs, the gantry angle, collimator angle, and posterior jaw size of the tangential beams are derived from the separating plane equation. Dosimetric measures of the treatment plans determined by the automated method are compared with those obtained by applying manual beam placement by the physicians. The method can be further extended to use multileaf collimator (MLC) blocking by optimizing posterior MLC positions. Result(s): The plans for 36 patients (23 prone- and 13 supine-treated) with left breast cancer were analyzed. Our algorithm reduced the volume of the heart that receives >500 cGy dose (V5) from 2.7 to 1.7 cm3 (p = 0.058) on average and the volume of the ipsilateral lung that receives >1000 cGy dose (V10) from 55.2 to 40.7 cm3 (p = 0.0013). The dose coverage as measured by volume receiving >95 of the prescription dose (V95) of the WB without a 5 mm superficial layer decreases by only 0.74 (p = 0.0002) and the V95 for the tumor bed with 1.5 cm margin remains unchanged. Conclusion(s): This study has demonstrated the feasibility of using a SVM-based algorithm to determine optimal beam placement without a physician's intervention. The proposed method reduced the dose to OARs, especially for supine treated patients, without any relevant degradation of dose homogeneity and coverage in general. © 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",2012,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,NA,2536-2543,NA,5,39,NA,Med.

There is conflicting research regarding latency as a significant factor in the onset of simulator sickness. Predictive compensation has been shown to mitigate the magnitude of latency, but little is known about the extent of its effect on simulator sickness. A video camera recorded HMD and simulator imagery to accurately measure apparent latency produced at three head movement frequencies. Predictive compensation strategies were manipulated to measure the difference in apparent latency produced by the test bed in various conditions. Similar methodology was employed with human participants to measure simulator sickness experienced by users of this test bed. In Experiment 1, apparent latency increased significantly as head movement frequency increased. Predictive compensation strategies significantly reduced apparent latency present in the test bed. In Experiment 2, predictive compensation significantly reduced the magnitude of simulator sickness. Predictive compensation can be effectively implemented to reduce apparent latency, resulting in a lower magnitude of simulator sickness. Potential applications include HMD use in which head position is tracked and visual imagery is linked to head or body movement, such as in virtual and augmented reality systems, and is thus critical to functionality and performance.",2012,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,NA,235-249,NA,2,54,NA,Hum Factors,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed13&NEWS=N&AN=365051187,artificial neural network; physiology; article; human; adolescent; adult; female; male; controlled study; computer simulation; clinical trial; pathophysiology; randomized controlled trial; controlled clinical trial; task performance; *movement (physiology); *head; *helmet; *information processing; *motion sickness,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Method(s): ECG, Cardiac Markers, vital signs and HRV parameters were collected for chest pain patients at initial presentation in SGH Emergency Department (ED). These features are selected in the SVM model for classifying patients into risk categories, along with a predicted probability to encounter adverse cardiac events, which includes cardiac arrest, death, lethal arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock requiring inotropes or IABP, acute heart failure, bradycardia requiring pacing and recurrent ischaemia requiring CABG or PCI within 72 hours of arrival. Result(s): 567 patients were recruited and 3.2% of patients met with the primary outcome. The SVM undergoes supervised machine learning by automatically separating the data into 80% training set and 20% validation set. Feature selection that includes ECG abnormalities + Cardiac Markers + vital signs + HRV [A] produces an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.842 while combined input of ECG abnormalities + vital signs + HRV [B] has a similar performance - AUC of 0.830 (A vs. B, P=0.430). In comparison, feature input of only ECG abnormalities [C] or ECG abnormalities + Cardiac Markers [D] has AUC of 0.633 (B vs. C, P=0.0232) and 0.654 (B vs. D, P=0.0835), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the best model [A] are 77.8% and 81.1%, respectively. Conclusion(s): SVM is a promising risk stratification approach for triaging chest pain patients for adverse cardiac complications.

We aim to validate a novel Machine Learning (ML) score incorporating Heart Rate Variability (HRV) for triage of critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department by comparing the area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity with the modified early warning score (MEWS). Method(s): We conducted a prospective observational study of critically ill patients in an emergency department of a tertiary hospital. At presentation, HRV parameters generated from a 5 minute electrocardiogram recording are incorporated with age and vital signs to generate the ML score for each patient. The patients are then followed-up for outcomes of cardiac arrest or death. Result(s): From June 2006-June 2008, we enrolled 925 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for ML scores in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours is 0.781 (95% CI: 0.724-0.839) as compared to 0.680 (95% CI: 0.597-0.762) for MEWS.

However, differences between in-vitro and in-vivo physiology need to be more fully characterised to hasten the movement of new technologies from bench to bedside. Here we report on the ability of living neural networks in-vitro to serve as a model for short-term memory. We use a novel combination of optogenetics and computational methods to measure the duration, specificity and capacity of these memories. Method(s): Primary cultures of E18 disassociated rat cortical neurons were plated on multielectrode arrays (MEAs) and transfected using channelrhodopsin-2, rendering them light sensitive. The cultures were optically stimulated using a laser to project complex random dot stimuli onto the dish. Action potentials were recorded extracellularly and analysed using different biologically plausible classification algorithms to determine the capacity and duration of stimulus-specific memories. Result(s): The pattern of activity elicited by optical stimulation was detectably different for all 30 random dot stimuli tested (n=8 cultures). The best classification methods could analyse a neural response and correctly identify which of the 30 stimuli had elicited the response on 80% of trials (chance=3.3%). These neural responses persisted as memories even after optical stimulation was removed. The average duration of a memory was 675 ms (range: 0.2-1.2 seconds, n=6 cultures). In many cultures, the response of the network to a second stimulus depended on the identity of the stimulus that came before. The processing of new stimuli was influenced by the memory of past stimulation at delays as long as 2 seconds. Conclusion(s): These results demonstrate that mechanisms of information-processing and short-term memory can be studied using cultured neuronal networks, thereby setting the stage for investigating therapeutic applications using this platform.",2012,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,NA,S102,NA,SUPPL. 1,21,NA,Proc.

For example, a behavior therapy instructs to go to bed only when sleepy but may not be effective if the patient goes to bed when fatigued and not sleepy. Recently it has been suggested that questionnaires of daytime fatigue be used in the treatment of chronic insomnia since fatigue, rather than sleepiness, is a prominent daytime symptom. The aim of the present study was to quantify the meaning of sleepy, tired, and fatigued using the Semantic Differential Technique and to compare them in good and poor sleepers. Method(s): A principal components analysis was used to derive a set of 13 polar opposite scales (e.g. pleasant-unpleasant, active-passive, light heavy) on the basis of their high loadings on the three most signiicant orthogonal components described as evaluative, activity, and potency. The concepts of ""sleepy"", ""tired"", and ""fatigued"" were then rated using these 13 scales by 125 young adult university students, half of whom were poor sleepers with a PSQI score >6. Result(s): Fatigued was judged as more negative, active, and potent than sleepy with tired rated intermediately but closer to fatigued. There were no differences in these ratings between the good and poorer sleepers. The quantiied meanings of these terms could also be viewed in 3-Dimensional space and the direct spatial distance between them calculated. There was a signiicant distance between sleepy and fatigued in this semantic space. Conclusion(s): This semantic differential technique showed a considerable difference in the meanings of sleepy and fatigued. In this study we found no difference between good and poor sleepers in these meanings. However, clinically diagnosed chronic insomniacs should also be studied. In any case these results highlight the need for sleep researchers and clinicians to use separate measuring scales for sleepy and fatigued.",2012,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,NA,A237-A238,NA,SUPPL. 1,35,NA,Sleep,NA,"26th Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC, SLEEP 2012.

We compared self-reported symptoms in subjects undergoing 62h of total sleep deprivation versus controls to examine whether symptomology is inluenced by sleep loss. Method(s): 26 healthy, non-smoking young adults (ages 22-37; 10 females) with regular sleep schedules spent 6 consecutive days and nights in a sleep laboratory. Following two baseline days (10h TIB/day), subjects were randomized to either 62h total sleep deprivation (n=13) or matching control (10h TIB/day; n=13), which was followed by two recovery days (10h TIB/day). Assignment to condition was announced just before bedtime at the end of the second baseline day. Throughout most of scheduled wakefulness, at 2h intervals subjects completed the 58-item, 5-subscale Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL), the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), and a 10min Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT). Mixed-effects ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed to examine the effects of condition and time-in-study on HSCL subjective symptoms, KSS subjective sleepiness, and PVT lapses (RT>500ms). Result(s): Signiicant effects of condition were found for HSCL Obsessive- Compulsive (F[1,666]=4.5, P=0.034), HSCL Interpersonal Sensitivity (F[1,668]=5.4, P=0.020), KSS sleepiness (F[1,671]=5.5, P=0.012) and PVT lapses (F[1,670]=23.8, P<0.001). Signiicant condition by time interactions were found for HSCL Somatization (F[28,665]=3.6, P<0.001), HSCL Obsessive-Compulsive (F[28,666]=1.6, P=0.024), KSS sleepiness (F[28,671]=8.1, P<0.001) and PVT lapses (F[28,670]=10.7, P<0.001). PCA indicated that the 5 HSCL subscales clustered together (16.8% variance explained); and that KSS and PVT clustered together (57.1% variance explained) but with a pattern distinct from the HSCL.

Conclusion(s): Subjects in the sleep deprivation condition exhibited higher levels of self-reported symptomology, which remained elevated throughout the experiment but were below published norms for clinical samples.

embase,agosto,SNJ64MGD,journalArticle,2012,Zenker S.; Begerau H.; Thull B.,Modular decoupling of data acquisition from analysis and visualization in acute care monitoring to facilitate evaluation and implementation of new derived parameters and visualization techniques: Concept and prototype implementation,Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing,NA,1387-1307,10.1007/s10877-012-9352-2,NA,"Introduction Traditionally, acute care patient monitoring equipment has consisted of one integrated device that performs the three key steps of data acquisition through signal conditioning and analog-to-digital conversion (A), biosignal processing and analysis (P) such as heart rate detection and ST segment analysis from electrocardiograms, and visualization/display (V) of the measured and derived data. In recent years, a number of so-called functional monitoring parameters that are computed from standard physiological measurements have shown clinical value and predictive power superior to most previously available parameters. A prime example is the pulse pressure variability (PPV), which predicts fluid responsiveness in patients on positive pressure ventilation1. More complex approaches to exploiting unused information in currently available physiological measurements are currently under development (e.g., 2). However, the evaluation and clinical application of even the simplest of these approaches is hindered by the fact that in standard clinical settings, replacement of the entire monitoring equipment is required for a new parameter to permeate into clinical practice. Although, in theory, firmware upgrades of monitoring hardware could provide such enhanced features, manufacturers are, in practice, reluctant to implement such alterations due to regulatory issues. As a consequence, PPV has only become available in recent patient monitors, more than a decade after the clinical usefulness of this parameter was recognized, indicating that the current setup of our monitoring infrastructure may hinder innovation. In contrast, a modular framework that transparently decouples A, P, and V steps would remove a major obstacle preventing the rapid evaluation and early, broad adoption of novel derived monitoring parameters and visualization techniques that may help to optimize treatment. Here, we describe a technical framework that may make such decoupling practical, and describe first steps towards implementation in a research setting. Methods A modular software architecture was designed that decouples the A, P, and V steps outlined above. First, server side data storage and processing (A and P steps) is separated from client side visualization (V step) in a client-server model. On the server side, an abstract model of server side data acquisition and processing was developed and implemented that allows for the deployment of arbitrary data sourcing and processing graph topologies, where nodes are elementary modules consisting of data source access code (either online or offline/database based) and processing code (such as signal processing modules implementing, e.g., filters, and physiological analysis modules that generate derived parameter timeseries from existing parameters, such as PPV computation), and edges are signals of various dimensionality and data type. Preliminary testing of the prototype was performed to prepare for first bedside evaluations. For implementation of the server-side software infrastructure, JavaTM was used to allow for clean interface/implementation separation and facilitate maintenance and future development. On the client side, a dynamic JavaScriptTM implementation of timeseries visualization running in standard browsers supporting HTML5 (canvas tag) was chosen. For client-server communication, JSON encoded data is transmitted via HTTP. Results The described architecture proved to provide sufficient performance for interactive visualization and manipulation of physiological data streams in the test environment. The abstract, modular design of the server-side data access and processing infrastructure facilitates code reuse since modules for filtering, peak detection, etc., can be reused for arbitrary raw or derived signals, and simplifies development, testing, and roll-out of new analysis and data processing modules. The browser-based client visualization implementation minimizes support efforts required on the client side, with the potential of delivering a state-of-the art look and feel on both mobile and stationary devices. Since novel derived parameters are, from the perspective of the clientside visualization module, indistinguishable from other physiological timeseries, a seamless user experience is achieved. Discussion The described framework provides an infrastructure that has the potential to, once established in a specific clinical environment, significantly lower the threshold that has to be overcome before a novel derived monitoring parameter can be evaluated and, eventually, clinically applied. The seamless integration of novel analysis results into a familiar visualization environment should serve to lower the acceptance threshold of new parameters or visualization approaches among clinicians, while simultaneously minimizing non-specific effects of an altered clinical environment on study endpoints in prospective validation studies of novel parameters or visualization techniques. The modular design and standardized interfaces facilitate well-structured development and validation procedures in a research setting, while reducing errors through structured code reuse. Since development and live deployment can be performed within the same framework by exchanging offline for online data source nodes, significant sources of error and delay are eliminated. While the current prototype shows promise in greatly facilitating the development, evaluation, and deployment of novel derived monitoring parameters and visualization techniques in an academic environment, and may help to smooth the path to a more widespread implementation, translation of this approach to a commercial setting will require careful attention to regulatory issues. However, the combination of open interface standards and modern cryptographic techniques with a structured certification process should allow for regulatory decoupling and separate certification of A, P, and V components that would result in a plug-and-play architecture for acute care monitoring similar in flexibility to what is already common in the audio signal processing market, where signal acquisition, analysis, synthesis, output, and editing seamlessly interoperate through the use of open standards. Since there is little commercial incentive to create such an open environment, with vendors often keen on marketing any minimal advance as a unique feature of their entire integrated monitoring package, widespread implementation of such a concept, while of potentially large value for both clinicians and patients, will likely require a coordinated push by users and regulatory authorities.",2012,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,NA,232-233,NA,4,26,NA,J.

Actigraphy on the other hand is both cheap and user-friendly, but for many studies lacks detailed information and accuracy. Over the years, however, extensive research has been done on changes in heart and breathing rate across sleep stages and during different sleep disorder related events. Our aim was to evaluate the use of heart rate, breathing rate and movement in discriminating between REM and NREM sleep. Method(s): The dataset comprised 85 nights from a healthy population (age 22.1 +/- 3.2 years); 57 nights were taken as training set, 28 nights as test set. No nights from the same person were present in both training and test set to ensure that there was no person-specific training. Heart rate was extracted from ECG, breathing rate from Respiratory Inductance Plethysmography and movement from a changing mattress indentation measured by sensors integrated in the bed. In a first test series, signals where split in parts of five epochs (150 s) belonging to the same class (REM and NREM), excluding shorter intervals. In a second test series, signals where split in parts of two epochs (60 s), where if at least one epoch belonged to class REM, the entire interval was labelled as REM. From a broad set of 4094 predefined features, a subset was forwardly selected (test series-specific) on the training set using a minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance criterion, based on mutual information calculation via kernel density estimation. The final classification of REM versus NREM was performed using Weka (data mining software), more specifically using Random Forests with 25 decision trees of 15 features each. Result(s): For the first test series, a classification accuracy of 84.2% was reached on the test set, corresponding to a Cohen's kappa of 0.69 and a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) of 0.91. True positive rate for class REM and NREM were respectively 0.87 and 0.81. The second test series gave a classification accuracy of 81.0%, a Cohen's kappa of 0.62 and a ROC of 0.88. True positive rate for class REM and NREM were respectively 0.77 and 0.85. Conclusion(s): The results show the significant correlation of heart rate, breathing rate and movement towards the distinction between REM and NREM sleep.

An under-appreciated hurdle for translational SCI testing is the need to manage and integrate massive amounts of data produced by basic research. Here, we demonstrate a novel data-driven approach for SCI data integration and visualization. Methods Visualization tools combined with multivariate statistical analysis has the potential to aid translation. Our goal is to develop user-friendly analytical tools that can interface with large databases for novel discoveries by members of the general SCI research community. The current project reports on a collaborative effort between an academic medical center (UCSF-BASIC) and a Silicon Valley startup (Ayasdi Inc.) to develop a bioinformatic data analysis/visualization system to assist bench-to-bedside translation. We applied a novel computational approach called topological data analysis (TDA), wherein complex datasets are computed and rendered into geometric visual representations. Clusters of subjects appear as nodes and relations among clusters are represented as interconnections ('edges') among nodes. We tuned the analysis parameters for reliable translation across different injury severities and types (IH vs. NYU contusion vs. hemisection) using a database subset of rats (N = 159) with unilateral cervical SCI collected at OSU and UCSF. Results Proof-of-concept TDA on our large preclinical cervical SCI dataset produced fruitful rapid visualization and large-scale data-driven mining of the preclinical SCI syndrome. Subjects were compared simultaneously on 120 biomechanical, histological, and functional outcome measures using a principal components 'lens' that clusters subjects into nodes based on shared variability, and into flares based on similarities between nodes. Node size reflects the number of subjects within a given node, and node color represents the values of the specified variable or outcome measure and where that falls along a spectral continuum of highest (red) to lowest (blue). For this specific cervical dataset, after the network topology is derived, these node colors are determined using a colored density map to assess the importance of 4 key variables often used in univariate analyses of SCI datasets: 1) spinal cord tissue compression, 2) white matter sparing, 3) grooming scores, and 4) motoneuron sparing. Clusters of subjects with values for each of these variables were graphed onto the spectral continuum from highest to lowest. Subjects receiving the most severe tissue compression during injury clustered together in a single flare. Subjects with less severe injuries clustered in another flare, and intermediate levels clustered in a third flare. The same essential pattern was observed in the outcomes: white matter sparing, grooming score, motoneuron sparing. However, none of these standard outcomes taken in isolation could fully account subject clustering across the syndromic network, highlighting the value of multivariate integration. In future work, we will cross-validate the tuned analytic approach with the additional data contributions from other centers to discover a set of analytic parameters with the goal of enabling translational comparisons across mouse, rat, and primate datasets. Conclusions Early proof-of-concept work is demonstrating that TDA can describe a range of SCI syndrome patterns in preclinical models using a userfriendly graphical interface. Further work is needed, however, to demonstrate whether a common set of analysis parameters can yield stable networks across a wide diversity of injury types, different laboratories, and across species. Our long-term goal is to facilitate these critical translational comparisons to provide a common analytic platform for integrative multivariate data analysis and data-mining of SCI research. The current collaborative data analysis system shows great promise for providing an integrated system for translational bioinformatics research in the SCI field.",2012,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,2022-08-24T07:29:47Z,NA,A82,NA,10,29,NA,J.

embase,agosto,4Y2E8FHZ,journalArticle,2012,Fauconnier A.; Fritel X.; Ballout El Maoula A.; Varas C.; Dompeyre P.; Bader G.,Validation of a new screening instrument for assessment of urinary incontinence in women: The self-assessment leakage circumstances questionnaire (LCQ),Neurourology and Urodynamics,NA,0733-2467,10.1002/nau.22287,NA,"Hypothesis/aims of study There are several validated instruments design to measure symptom severity and degree of bother, in case of urinary incontinence (UI) in women, such as the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ). Admittedly, these instruments do not assess finely urinary leakage circumstances. For example, the brief effort dimension correlates with question #3 of the UDI-6, which combines three components into a single question, ""Do you experience leakage of urine related to coughing, sneezing and laughing"" instead of evaluating each circumstance (coughing, sneezing, and laughing) independently. In addition, many of the other leakage events are not represented on these validated questionnaires. Our team has previously developed the Leakage Circumstances Questionnaire (LCQ), a self questionnaire to characterize leakage circumstances in women consulting for urinary incontinence [1]. The aim of the present study was (i) to test the data quality, scaling assumptions, scoring algorithms and structure of the questionnaire underlying the leakage circumstance questionnaire (ii) to test construct validity by examining the association between each dimension score and patients clinical or urodynamics characteristics. Study design, materials and methods We conducted a prospective analysis of 215 consecutive patients operated for SUI by suburethral sling between April 2007 and December 2011. Each one was evaluated using a self assessed questionnaire recording leakage occurrence in 23 casual circumstances (table) rated in a four class response rating from ""No, not at all"", to ""Yes, a lot"". Other preoperative data were assessed by clinical and urodynamical examination. Principal components analysis was performed to determine the dimensions for leakage circumstances. Cronbach's alpha for each was calculate to assess the internal consistency for each dimension. Construct validity was assessed by testing predefined hypotheses about relationship between leakage circumstances and definite clinical or urodynamics conditions. Results 189 patients responded the questionnaire (87.9%). Missing response rates ranged from 22.2 % (sneezing) to 42.3% (having sex, and orgasm). Among the leakage circumstances, the principal components analysis permitted to distinguish 4 stable dimensions (table): leakage occurring while efforts (i. e. coughing; sneezing, laughing, running, sport, lifting...Cronbach's alpha = 0.89), under stimulating circumstances (contact with water, arriving near the toilets, cold, fear, urge...; Cronbach's alpha = 0.81), while changing position (i. e. Standing, leaving bed, leaning forward.; Cronbach's alpha = 0.72) and with sexe (during intercourse and orgasm; Cronbach's alpha = 0.69). Several items (walking, going up or down stairs, while sleeping) were found to have different sense among women. For each patient, dimension scores were determined as the sum of the item values within their own dimension. The effort dimension score decreased with aging (r = -0.35; p<.0001), increased with visual analog scale for bothersome (r=0.53; p<.0001), increased with the amount of urinary leakage (r=0.43; p<.0001), increased with the degree of stress incontinence assessed by the physician (r=0.542; p<.0001). The stimulation dimension, increased with visual analog scale for bothersome (r=0.30; p=.0001)), increased with the amount of urinary leakage 0.26; p=0.001, decreased with increasing [le delai de retenu] (r=-0.35; p<.0001), increased with the degree of urge incontinence assessed by the physician (r=0.53; p<.0001). The position dimension score increased with visual analog scale for bothersome (r=0.45; p<.0001), increased with the amount of urinary leakage (r=0.50; p<.0001), decreased with increasing time to delay passing urine (r=-0.26; p=.0008), increased with the degree of urge incontinence assessed by the physician (r=0.50; p<.0001), increase with the degree of stress incontinence assessed by the physician (r=0.42; p<.0001), decrease with increasing MUCP (r=-0.17, p=0.0238), The sexual dimension only showed a slight correlation with the degree of stress incontinence assessed by the physician (r=0.14; p<.0001). Patient with intrinsic sphincter deficiency (MUCP < 30 cm H20) had higher position dimension scoring than other patient. Interpretation of results Our results suggest that more than 2 different mechanisms might be involved in female urinary incontinence. The LCQ allows distinction between classical effort that relate to important increase of abdominal pressure and a positional domain that may relate to minor increase of abdominal pressure suggesting the role of sphincter deficiency. Similar finding was found out [1]. The four dimensions are consistent with common sense and physiopathology and very meaningful for the clinician. They are already used in everyday practice to evaluate urinary incontinence as recommended by the Standardization and Terminology Committees IUGA-CS: the effort dimension which corresponds to stress incontinence and the stimulation dimension score which is comparable to urge incontinence, the positional dimension relates to the postural incontinence, while the sexe dimension relate to coital incontinence [2]. The LCQ provide an atheoritical manner to measure in routine the extent of each of these four domains. Concluding message The leakage circumstance questionnaire may be valid for the pre-operative assessment of women with stress urinary incontinence and mixed urinary incontinence. If our hypothesis postulating that leakage circumstances are related to specific mechanisms is correct, leakage circumstances should constitute prognostic factors to predict the success of the suburethral sling procedure.

Method(s): ECG, cardiac markers, vital signs, and HRV parameters were collected for chest pain patients at initial presentation in the SGH emergency department (ED). These features are selected in various combinations in the SVM model for classifying patients into their corresponding risk categories, along with a predicted probability that each patient will experience adverse cardiac events. The predicted adverse cardiac events include cardiac arrest, death, lethal arrhythmia cardiogenic shock requiring inotropes or IABP, acute heart failure, bradycardia requiring pacing, and recurrent ischemia requiring CABG or PCI within 72 hours of arrival. Result(s): 567 patients were recruited and 3.2% of patients with the primary outcome. The SVM undergoes supervised machine learning by automatically separating the data into 80% training set and 20% validation set. Feature selection that includes ECG abnormalities + cardiac markers + vital signs + HRV [A] produces an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.842 while combined input of ECG abnormalities + vital signs + HRV [B] has a similar performance with an AUC of 0.830 (A vs. B, p = 0.430). In comparison feature input of only ECG abnormalities [C] or ECG abnormalities + cardiac markers [D] has an AUC of 0.633 (B vs. C, p = 0.0232) and 0.654 (B vs. D p = 0.0835), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the best model [A] are 77.8% and 81.1%, respectively. Conclusion(s): SVM is a promising risk stratification approach for triaging chest pain patients for adverse cardiac complications. The prediction performance will likely improve with each patient it encounters iteratively.

The presentation of the symptom is protean, and varies from person to person and from disease stage to disease stage. WOMAC pain sub scores assess a subject's pain while: 1) In bed; 2) Walking; 3) Climbing stairs; 4) Standing; and 5) Lying down. These five categories reflect, presumably, different etiologies of pain. To better understand the etiology of pain in these settings, the OAI has been capturing thousands of variables (variable is a specific clinical data) in OA patients; hopefully, evaluation of these variables will allow a better understanding of OA, and establish predictors of OA related pain. The objective of this work was to use automated wide association tools to determine which OAI variables, singularly or in association with other variables, best predict future OA related pain. Method(s): The 4786 OAI enrolled subjects and the 1226 variables of the OAI baseline clinical datasets (OAI:0.2.2) and the 36 month WOMAC pain sub-score data (OAI:5.2.1) were explored in this study. Baseline variables with more than 10% of missing informationwere removed. Subjects with 36 month missing WOMAC pain data were removed. Therefore, only 4204 patients and 629 variables were included in this study. Furthermore, to explore the no-pain related sources of future knee pain all baseline pain related variables were removed. The max value from the left and right knee pain sub-scores were used as the outcome variable to be predicted by a five variable multidimensional nearest centroid classifier using BIOMATEC (Monterrey, Mexico). The top predictor variables of each pain sub-score were selected after generating 5000 models using a 33%, 67% split between training and testing sets. Once the top variables were selected, linear models and R software were used to get the significance of those variables in predicting the 36 month WOMAC pain scores. Result(s): All linear regression models were highly significant (p<1.0-10) with R2 ranging from 0.199 to 0.328. Left knee catch or hand up when moving, folate supplements, having a symptomatic knee, physical scale and right knee stiffness score predicted pain while lying down. Health limiting moderate activities, WOMAC knee stiffness, left knee KOOS symptoms and blood pressure predicted pain in Bed. Climbing stairs pain was predicted by lack of confidence in knees and WOMAC disability score. Health limiting moderate activities, left knee swelling, lack of confidence in knees and WOMAC stiffness score predicted pain while walking. Standing pain was predicted by KOOS symptom score and 400 meters walk time physical test. Conclusion(s): Wide association studies can be very helpful in data mining the OAI databases. These tools were used to explore models predictive of the 36 month pain sub scores and yielded highly predicting models. Therefore, three year pain prognosis is possible using clinical data.

Surface electromyographic signals recorded from five superficial lumbo-pelvic muscles during a repetitive knee movement task. The task, which required stabilisation of the lumbo-pelvic region, was performed at multiple movement speeds and at multiple time points during and after bed-rest. After excluding effects that could be attributed to increases in subcutaneous fat changes and improvements in movement skill, we found that the RVE intervention ameliorated the generalised increases in activity ratios between movement speeds (p<= 0.012), reductions in lumbo-pelvic extensor and flexor co-contraction (p= 0.058) and increases in root-mean-square electromyographic amplitude (p= 0.001) of the lumbar erector spinae muscles. Effects of RVE on preventing increases in amplitude-modulation (p=23) of the lumbar erector spinae muscles were not significant. Few significant changes in activation-timing were seen. The RVE intervention during bed-rest, with indirect loading of the spine during exercise, was capable of reducing some, but not all, motor control changes in the lumbo-pelvic musculature during and after bed-rest. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,2022-08-24T07:29:48Z,2022-08-24T07:29:48Z,NA,21-30,NA,1,22,NA,J.

Method(s): This pilot study of a newly-developed continuous pressure imaging technology (XSEN SOR ForeSite Patient Turn System) involved two phases of videotaped observation of medical inpatients, with each patient serving as his/her own control: a control phase in which continuous pressure imaging was not available to health-care providers and an intervention phase where it was. The primary outcome was to determine whether access to the technology influenced the rate of patient turns/shifts by nursing staff. Secondary outcomes included a comparison of the rates of other care provider shifts, patient self-shifts, and family assisted shifts. Qualitative data regarding nurse and patient/family perspectives were also obtained. Result(s): Complete control/intervention data were available for nine patients. The mean rate of twoperson assisted turns was 0.274 +/- 0.087 turns per hour in the control phase versus 0.413 +/- 0.091 turns per hour in the intervention phase (p=0.08). For the combined endpoint of two-person assisted turns or patient transfers off the bed into a wheelchair/chair, there was a statistically significant difference in the mean number of turns per hour: mean of 0.491 +/- 0.271 turns per hour for the intervention group versus 0.327 +/- 0.235 turns per hour for the control group (p=0.04). Provider interviews confirmed that nurses used information from the technology to inform their patient shifting strategies and behaviours. Conclusion(s): This pilot study provides some initial data supporting the hypothesis that continuous pressure imaging technology could positively impact the frequency of patient turns by care providers, as well as provide impetus to inspect specific skin locations, thereby providing a potential targeted risk mitigation strategy for the development of pressure ulcers.",2012,2022-08-24T07:29:48Z,2022-08-24T07:29:48Z,NA,517-527,NA,11,21,NA,J.

E, Statistical, nonlinear, and soft matter physics",NA,1550-2376 (electronic),NA,NA,"By means of the concept of the balanced estimation of diffusion entropy, we evaluate the reliable scale invariance embedded in different sleep stages and stride records. Segments corresponding to waking, light sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and deep sleep stages are extracted from long-term electroencephalogram signals. For each stage the scaling exponent value is distributed over a considerably wide range, which tell us that the scaling behavior is subject and sleep cycle dependent. The average of the scaling exponent values for waking segments is almost the same as that for REM segments (~0.8). The waking and REM stages have a significantly higher value of the average scaling exponent than that for light sleep stages (~0.7). For the stride series, the original diffusion entropy (DE) and the balanced estimation of diffusion entropy (BEDE) give almost the same results for detrended series. The evolutions of local scaling invariance show that the physiological states change abruptly, although in the experiments great efforts have been made to keep conditions unchanged. The global behavior of a single physiological signal may lose rich information on physiological states. Methodologically, the BEDE can evaluate with considerable precision the scale invariance in very short time series (~10^{2}), while the original DE method sometimes may underestimate scale-invariance exponents or even fail in detecting scale-invariant behavior. The BEDE method is sensitive to trends in time series. The existence of trends may lead to an unreasonably high value of the scaling exponent and consequent mistaken conclusions.",2012,2022-08-24T07:29:48Z,2022-08-24T07:29:48Z,NA,056107,NA,5 Pt 2,86,NA,Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed13&NEWS=N&AN=366406022,article; methodology; computer simulation; entropy; *actimetry; *algorithm; *physiologic monitoring; *electroencephalography; *computer assisted diagnosis; diffusion; *statistical analysis,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The gold standard of dysphagia detection is videofluoroscopy which exposes the child to ionizing radiation, and requires specialized clinical expertise and expensive institutionally-based equipment, precluding day-to-day and repeated assessment of fluctuating swallowing function. Swallowing accelerometry is the non-invasive measurement of cervical vibrations during swallowing and may provide a portable and cost-effective bedside alternative. In particular, dual-axis swallowing accelerometry has demonstrated screening potential in older persons with neurogenic dysphagia, but the technique has not been evaluated in the pediatric population. In this study, dual-axis accelerometric signals were collected simultaneous to videofluoroscopic records from 29 pediatric participants (age 6.8 +/- 4.8 years; 20 males) previously diagnosed with neurogenic dysphagia. Participants swallowed 3-5 sips of barium-coated boluses of different consistencies (normally, from thick puree to thin liquid) by spoon or bottle. Videofluoroscopic records were reviewed retrospectively by a clinical expert to extract swallow timings and ratings. The dual-axis acceleration signals corresponding to each identified swallow were pre-processed, segmented and trimmed prior to feature extraction from time, frequency, time-frequency and information theoretic domains. Feature space dimensionality was reduced via principal components. Using 8-fold cross-validation, 16-17 dimensions and a support vector machine classifier with an RBF kernel, an adjusted accuracy of 89.6% +/- 0.9 was achieved for the discrimination between swallows with and with out airway entry.

Conference,NA,1557-170X,NA,NA,"This paper proposes a markerless video analytic system for quantifying body part movements in pediatric epilepsy monitoring. The system utilizes colored pajamas worn by a patient in bed to extract body part movement trajectories, from which various features can be obtained for seizure detection and analysis. Hence, it is non-intrusive and it requires no sensor/marker to be attached to the patient's body. It takes raw video sequences as input and a simple user-initialization indicates the body parts to be examined. In background/foreground modeling, Gaussian mixture models are employed in conjunction with HSV-based modeling. Body part detection follows a coarse-to-fine paradigm with graph-cut-based segmentation. Finally, body part parameters are estimated with domain knowledge guidance. Experimental studies are reported on sequences captured in an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at a local hospital.

Method(s): A natural experiment of 8 medical-surgical inpatient units used 2 questionnaires developed for the study. The first questionnaire was available to registered nurses. The second was available to the nurses' patients. Result(s): Compared with participants on the mirrored unit configuration, participants on the same-handed unit configuration reported lower noise levels, better sleep quality, more frequent approaches to patients' right side, and improved satisfaction with organization of the workspace at patients' bedsides. The increased right-side approach was related to fewer instances of patients catching themselves from falling. Conclusion(s): The same-handed unit configuration benefits patient experience, patient safety, and operational outcomes. Before renovation or new construction of units, nurse executives should consider the advantages of a same-handed unit configuration.

The diarylquinoline TMC207 is a highly promising drug candidate for treatment of tuberculosis. This compound kills M. tuberculosis by binding to a new target, mycobacterial ATP synthase. In this study we used biochemical assays and binding studies to characterize the interaction between TMC207 and ATP synthase. We show that TMC207 acts independent of the proton motive force and does not compete with protons for a common binding site. The drug is active on mycobacterial ATP synthesis at neutral and acidic pH with no significant change in affinity between pH 5.25 and pH 7.5, indicating that the protonated form of TMC207 is the active drug entity. The interaction of TMC207 with ATP synthase can be explained by a one-site binding mechanism, the drug molecule thus binds to a defined binding site on ATP synthase. TMC207 affinity for its target decreases with increasing ionic strength, suggesting that electrostatic forces play a significant role in drug binding. Our results are consistent with previous docking studies and provide experimental support for a predicted function of TMC207 in mimicking key residues in the proton transfer chain and blocking rotary movement of subunit c during catalysis. Furthermore, the high affinity of TMC207 at low proton motive force and low pH values may in part explain the exceptional ability of this compound to efficiently kill mycobacteria in different microenvironments. © 2011 Haagsma et al.",2011,2022-08-24T07:29:49Z,2022-08-24T07:29:49Z,NA,e23575,NA,8,6,NA,PLoS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: United States Publisher: Public Library of Science (185 Berry Street, Suite 1300, San Francisco CA 94107, United States)",NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed12&NEWS=N&AN=362367922,article; binding affinity; nonhuman; controlled study; drug effect; molecular docking; drug targeting; static electricity; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Mycobacterium smegmatis; structure activity relation; drug binding site; enzyme inhibition; drug determination; antibacterial activity; *bedaquiline/an [Drug Analysis]; *bedaquiline/pd [Pharmacology]; *drug protein binding; *proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase/ec [Endogenous Compound]; acidity; bacterial enzyme/ec [Endogenous Compound]; concentration response; enzyme synthesis; ionic strength; proton motive force; proton transport,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hand washing with soap prevents respiratory disease morbidity but there is no direct evidence of its impact in preventing deaths from respiratory infection. We explored the contribution of household handwashing behavior to child mortality from respiratory diseases in rural Bangladesh. We obtained data on deaths among children <5 years of age from a large scale, sanitation, hygiene education and water supply intervention in rural Bangladesh which spanned 16 districts. To assess cause of death, we conducted verbal autopsies approximately 1 year after child death. Each death among a child <5 years (ICD-9 code 869.3-869.6) was age matched to three children from the same community who did not have respiratory symptoms at the time of interview. We interviewed family members, conducted 5 hours of household structured observation including observation for the presence of soap in the household. We constructed a socioeconomic index using principal component analysis of parental education, household assets, number of rooms, and housing material. We used logistic regression to adjust for immunization, socio-economic status, family size, and number of people sleeping in the same bed as child. Compared to 315 age matched healthy children, the 105 cases were more likely to have smaller families (p<0.001) and less educated mothers (p=0.012). Cases (29%) were more frequently assigned to the poorest wealth quintile than controls (18%). In multivariate analysis, having had any childhood vaccination [AOR: 0.26, CI: 0.11-0.58] and having any bar soap in the home [AOR: 0.53, CI: 0.29-0.98] was independently protective. Household participants washed hands in only 10 (2%) of 523 observed respiratory events such as coughing, sneezing, or nose cleaning or blowing. All 10 washed with only water. Household ownership of soap, a proxy hand washing measure was associated with deaths from respiratory disease. However, handwashing with soap was not practiced after contact with respiratory secretions. Understanding optimal strategies within households to interrupt respiratory pathogen transmission by hand washing would help decrease respiratory disease mortality as well as morbidity.",2011,2022-08-24T07:29:49Z,2022-08-24T07:29:49Z,NA,444,NA,6 SUPPL. 1,85,NA,Am.

The aim of this study is to assess the determinants of bed net usage (and bed net ownership) in children under 5. METHOD(S): Data were selected from households who had at least one child under 5. Outcome variables were: sleeping under a bed net/ITN the night prior to the survey and household ownership of at least one bed net. The explanatory variables were household characteristics and caregiver's knowledge of malaria. To analyse the effect of socio economic status (SES), an asset based score was created using principal component analysis. RESULT(S): A total of 3210 households with 5151 children under five participated in the study. Higher bed net usage was associated with being sick at some point in the last 14 days prior to the survey, urban area, more years of education of head of households, household ownership of at least one ITN (rather than an untreated net) and the year in which the survey took place. There was a decline of around 32% in the proportion of households that owned at least one bed net in 2009 compared to 2008. Knowing how malaria is prevented and transmitted, having the house sprayed in the previous 12 months, having fewer children under five in the household and having more children sick at some point in the previous 14 days were associated with higher household bed net ownership. CONCLUSION(S): The big fall in bed net usage from 2008 to 2009 is attributable to the striking decline in ownership. Although ownership is similar in rural and urban areas, rural households are less likely to protect their children with bed nets.",2011,2022-08-24T07:29:49Z,2022-08-24T07:29:49Z,NA,142,NA,SUPPL. 1,16,NA,Trop.

This prompted us to optimize MALDI imaging technology to evaluate spatial molecular distributions for proteomic signatures within focal regions of interest in the wound microenvironment. Our initial cutaneous studies were designed to establish baseline proteins that characterize the normal epidermis and dermis in the range of 2 to 20 kDa (N=10). The sensitivity of the MALDI-IMS technique was sufficient to establish the constitutive features of human skin as well as those associated with unique markers of individual variability. Subtle regional differences between the papillary and reticular dermis of normal skin were documented. In subsequent analyses of 8 pressure ulcers, distinguishing molecular differences were detected between the upper regions versus the lower regions of ulcers and were further contrasted against adjacent dermis and hypertrophic epidermal margins using protein profiles, ion density maps as well as principal component analysis and significant analysis of microarrays. Three molecules previously uncharacterized in pressure ulcers, the alpha-defensins (HNP-1, -2, -3), are highlighted as candidate markers with the potential to provide investigators with visual and statistical clues to suggest whether wound status is improving or prolonged in a deleterious, chronic state of inflammation.

The impact of habitual short sleep on auditory attention has not been studied to date. In the current study, we utilized novelty oddball tasks to evaluate the effect of habitual short sleep on brain function underlying attention control processes measured by the mismatch negativity (MMN, index of pre-attentive stage), P3a (attention-dependent), and P3b (memory-dependent) event related brain potentials (ERPs). An extended time in bed in a separate study was used to evaluate the possible reversal of the impairments of these processes in habitual short sleepers. Method(s): Ten self-defined short sleepers (total sleep time [TST] <= 6h) and 9 normal-sleeping subjects with TST 7-8 h, participated. ERPs were recorded via a 64-channel EEG system. Two test conditions: ""ignore"" and ""attend"" were implemented. The ERPs were analyzed and compared between groups on the 2 task conditions and frontal/central/parietal electrodes by 3-factor ANOVA. Sleep diary data were compared between groups by t-test. Sleep was recorded by the Zeo sleep monitoring system for a week in both habitual and extended sleep conditions at home. Result(s): The main findings of the present study show that short sleeping individuals had deficiency in activity of the MMN and P3a brain responses over frontal areas compared to normal-sleeping subjects. The P3b amplitude was increased over frontal areas and decreased over parietal with respect to the control group. Extension of time in bed for one week increased TST (from 5.7 h to 7.4 h), and concomitantly MMN amplitude increased from -0.1muV up to -1.25 muV over frontal areas. Conclusion(s): Reduced time in bed is associated with deficiency of the neuronal process associated with change detection, which may recover after one week of sleep extension, whereas attention-dependent neural processes do not normalize after this period of time in habitually short sleeping individuals and may require longer recovery periods.",2011,2022-08-24T07:29:49Z,2022-08-24T07:29:49Z,NA,1659-1670,NA,12,34,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: United States Publisher: Associated Professional Sleep Societies,LLC (2510 N.

Responders to therapy were found to have higher low-frequency (LF) power at baseline during wakefulness than non-responders, and responders had higher highfrequency (HF) power during therapy than non-responders on therapy. Furthermore, responders > 35 y had elevated LF power at baseline than non-responders > 35 y (p < 0.05).

Changes in the patterns of motor activities during sleep can be a disease marker, or can reflect various abnormal physiological and neurological conditions. Presently, there are no convenient, unobtrusive ways to assess quality of sleep outside of a clinic. This paper describes a system for unobtrusive detection of movement in bed that uses load cells installed at the corners of a bed. The system focuses on identifying when a movement occurs based on the forces sensed by the load cells. The movement detection approach estimates the energy in each load cell signal over short segments to capture the variations caused by movement. The accuracy of the detector is evaluated using data collected in the laboratory. The detector is capable of detecting voluntary movements in bed while the subjects were awake, with an average equal error rate of 3.22% (+/-0.54). Its performance is invariant with respect to the individual's characteristics, e.g., weight, as well as those of the bed. The simplicity of the resulting algorithms and their relative insensitivity to the weight and height of the monitored individual make the approach practical and easily deployable in residential and clinical settings.",2010,2022-08-24T07:29:50Z,2022-08-24T07:29:50Z,NA,481-490,NA,2,14,NA,IEEE Trans Inf Technol Biomed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed11&NEWS=N&AN=359863937,algorithm; physiology; article; human; female; male; methodology; middle aged; *actimetry; *wakefulness; *sleep; *bed; *movement (physiology); *automated pattern recognition; instrumentation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The proposed system consists of multiple cylindrical air cells, two sensor cells and 18 support cells, and the small physiological signals were measured by the changes in pressure difference between the sensor cells, and the dc component was removed by balancing tube that is connecting the sensor cells. Using newly developed AMBT method, heartbeat, respiration, snoring, and body movement signals were clearly measured. For the concept of a home healthcare system, two automatic processing algorithms were developed: one is to estimate the mean heart and respiration rates for every 30 s, and another one is to detect the snoring, sleep apnea, and body movement events from the measured signals. In the beat-to-beat heart rate and breath-by-breath respiration rate analyses, the correlation coefficients of the heart and respiration rates from the proposed AMBT method compared with reference methods, electrocardiogram, and respiration effort signal from piezoelectric belt, were 0.98 ( p << 0.01) and 0.96 ( p << 0.01), respectively. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of the detection algorithm for snoring event were 93%, 96%, for sleep apnea event were 93%, 88%, and for body movement event were 86%, 100%, respectively.

Although they have many benefits, they also have many potential complications. Confirming catheter tip position is essential to decreasing complications, but the best method to achieve confirmation is unclear. OBJECTIVE(S): Literature review for studies that address line position confirmation to assist health care providers in evaluating the available research and to identify gaps in the literature. METHOD(S): A literature search of four major databases followed by an ancestry approach was performed. Articles reviewed specifically discuss PICC lines and PICC line placement confirmation. RESULT(S): Data on confirming PICC placement were lacking. Fluoroscopic placement is ideal, but cannot be done at the bedside and is costly. Supine chest radiograph is the most widely used method and is convenient, but when line tip position is unclear, contrast or ultrasound confirmation can be used. When PICC lines are placed in the saphenous vein, infants may benefit from supine and lateral abdominal radiographs to ensure placement in the inferior vena cava. DISCUSSION: More studies are needed to generalize findings. PICC line tips should be located in the superior vena cava or inferior vena cava close to the junction with the right atrium (0.5-1 cm outside of the cardiac chambers in premature infants and 1-2 cm outside of the cardiac chambers in larger infants). Arm position is very important when performing radiographs for placement because movement of the arm can cause migration of the catheter. There is also significant inter-observer variability when identifying line tip position.",2010,2022-08-24T07:29:50Z,2022-08-24T07:29:50Z,NA,23-35,NA,1,29,NA,Neonatal Netw,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed11&NEWS=N&AN=358556966,infant; review; human; methodology; newborn; comparative study; reproducibility; evaluation; signal processing; supine position; *newborn intensive care; electrocardiography; contrast medium; observer variation; diagnostic agent; fluoroscopy; *abdominal radiography; *central venous catheterization; *thorax radiography; endoscopic echography; indwelling catheter,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A variety of systems can be used for BCG detection, including beds, tables, chairs, and weighing scales. Weighing scales, in particular, have several practical advantages over the alternatives: low cost, small size, unobtrusiveness, and familiarity to the user; one disadvantage is that the subject must stand during the recording, rather than sit or lay supine, resulting in a higher susceptibility to motion artifacts in the measured signal. This paper evaluates the electromyogram (EMG) signal acquired from the feet of the subject during BCG recording as a noise reference for standing BCG measurements. As a subject moves while standing on the scale, muscle contractions in the feet are detected by the EMG signal, and used to flag segments of the BCG signal that are corrupted by elevated noise. For the purposes of evaluating this method, estimates of the BCG noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) were independently calculated with an ensemble average method, using the R-wave of a simultaneously-acquired chest ECG as a timing reference. The linear correlation between EMG power alone and BCG NSR from 14 subjects was found to be moderate ( r = 0.58, F-statistic p -value 0.05); combined with body-mass index (BMI), multiple linear regression yielded a stronger correlation ( r = 0.73, F -statistic p-value = 0.01).

In particular, we take into consideration the heart rate variability (HRV) and respiratory signals for automatic sleep staging, arousals detection, and apnea recognition. This is particularly useful for wearable or textile devices that could be employed for home monitoring of sleep. The HRV and the respiration were analyzed in the frequency domain, and the statistics on the spectral and cross-spectral parameters put into evidence the possibility of a sleep evaluation on their basis. Comparison with traditional polysomnography (PSG) revealed a classification accuracy of 89.9% in rapid eye movement (REM) non-REM sleep separation and an accuracy of 88% for sleep apnea detection. Additional information can be achieved from the number of microarousals recognized in correspondence of typical modifications in the HRV signal. The obtained results support the idea of automatic sleep evaluation and monitoring through signals that are not traditionally used in clinical PSG, but can be easily recorded at home through wearable devices (for example, a sensorized T-shirt) or systems integrated into the environment (a sensorized bed).

The start time was determined by an algorithm based on the motion of the center of pressure (COP) on the mattress toward the front edge of the bed.

The results demonstrated that all right-breast patients benefited from the prone treatment position, while for left-breast patients, 85% were better treated prone and 15% were better treated supine. Using the clinical data collected from this protocol, the authors aimed at developing an automated tool capable of identifying which of the left-breast cancer patients are better treated supine without obtaining a second CT scan in the supine position. Method(s): Prone CT scans from 198 of the 200 left-breast cancer patients enrolled in NYU 05-181 protocol were deidentified and exported to a dedicated research planning workstation. Three-dimensional geometric features of the organs at risk and tumor bed were extracted. A two-stage classifier was used to classify patients into the prone class or the supine class. In the first stage, the authors use simple thresholding to divide the patients into two groups based on their in-field heart volume. For patients with in-field heart volume <= 0.1 cc, the prone position was chosen as the preferred treatment position. Patients with in-field heart volume >0.1 cc will be further classified in the second stage by a weighted support vector machine (SVM). The weight parameters of the SVM were adjusted to maximize the specificity [true-supine/ (true-supine+false-prone)] at the cost of lowering but still maintaining reasonable sensitivity [true-prone/ (true-prone+false-supine) ]. The authors used K -fold cross validations to test the performance of the SVM classifier. A feature selection algorithm was also used to identify features that give the best classification performance. Result(s): After the first stage, 49 of the 198 left-breast cancer patients were found to have >0.1 cc of in-field heart volume. The three geometric features of heart orientation,distance between heart and tumor, and in-field lung were selected by the feature selection algorithm in the second stage of the two-stage classifier to give the best predefined weighted accuracy. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method were found to be 90.4% and 99.3%, respectively. Using two-stage classification, the authors reduced the proportion of prone-treated patients that need a second supine CT scan down to 16.3/170 or 9.6%, as compared to 21/170 or 12.4% when the authors use only the first stage (thresholding) for classification. Conclusion(s): The authors' study showed that a feature-based classifier is feasible for predicting the preferred treatment position, based on features extracted from prone CT scans. The two-stage classifier achieved very high specificity at an acceptable expense of sensitivity. © 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",2010,2022-08-24T07:29:51Z,2022-08-24T07:29:51Z,NA,5341-5350,NA,10,37,NA,Med.

The dynamic active display (DAD) is a unique prototype interface that presents safety-critical visual icons to the driver in a manner that minimizes the deviation of his or her gaze direction without adding to unnecessary visual clutter. As part of an automotive safety system, the DAD presents alerts in the field of view of the driver only if necessary, which is based upon the state and pose of the driver, vehicle, and environment. This paper examines the effectiveness of DAD through a comprehensive comparative experimental evaluation of a speed compliance driver assistance system, which is implemented on a vehicular test bed. Three different types of display protocols for assisting a driver to comply with speed limits are tested on actual roadways, and these are compared with a conventional dashboard display. Given the inclination, drivers who are given an overspeed warning alert reduced the time required to slow down to the speed limit by 38% (p < 0.01) as compared with the drivers not given the alert. Additionally, certain alerts decreased distraction levels by reducing the time spent looking away from the road by 63% (p < 0.01).

The heart rate is measured with a thin sensor pad consisting of separate electromechanical film (EMFi) and polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) transducers located beneath the leg of chair or bed. This study aims to evaluate the operation of the sensor system with measurements, and also to compare the results provided by the two transducer materials. Based on the results obtained here, the heart rates measured with the transducers mainly corresponded to the values of reference ECG signal. Some minor differences between the heart rate values of PVDF and EMFi appeared, especially in supine position, possible due to the material sensitivities to different force directions.

Design(s): Twenty-two chronic pain outpatients (ages 24-70 years, mean 46.8) were recruited from a pain management center. After instruction, participants wore small, lightweight actigraphs on their dominant ankles for 7 days. They recorded any removals and kept a paper log of times in bed and at work. Participants then completed a set of self-report measures (order randomized): the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), the Pain Disability Index (PDI), the Pain Disability Questionnaire (PDQ), and the SF-36 Health Survey (SF-36), and a usability survey. Data mining techniques were applied to extract meaningful actigraph functions (eg, amount of time spent in sedentary activity). The derived functions were statistically compared with the questionnaire scores. Result(s): Pearson correlations between actigraphy functions and questionnaire scores were consistent with hypotheses: all functions except time in sedentary activity were negatively correlated with RMDQ, PDI and PDQ scores, and positively correlated with SF-36 scores. Higher non-sedentary activity was associated with a lower functional impact ratings. The percentage of time spent sedentary was positively related to a higher functional impact ratings. The most consistent pattern of correlations was with the pain-specific questionnaires (RMDQ, PDI, PDQ). Correlations were moderate between the actigraphy and self-report measures. Despite the small sample size, multiple regressions for the questionnaire scores on actigraphy variables were all significant (P<.05) except for the SF-36 Mental Component Score. Participants strongly endorsed their willingness to wear the device for clinical assessment. Conclusion(s): Actigraphy assessment of the functional impact of chronic pain is viable, with good construct validity. With ergonomic enhancements, this type of device is likely to be highly accepted by chronic pain patients. Functional assessment can be obtained from continuous actigraphy via a device worn on the ankle, without the need for further patient interaction.",2010,2022-08-24T07:29:52Z,2022-08-24T07:29:52Z,NA,S117,NA,9 SUPPL. 1,2,NA,PM R,NA,"71st Annual Assembly of the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

Progress, however, continues to be hampered by the lack of agreed, workable definitions for snoring and the absence of established standards and guidelines for recording and quantifying snores. Snoring is commonly assessed using questionnaire data, a process relying on human perception and recall. Most instruments are completed by the subject themselves, raising the issue of the accuracy of an assessment performed by an individual who is asleep at the time of the event. Partners tend to report more snoring than do the subjects themselves, but partner opinions are coloured by many inputs, including sensitivity to noise, gender and relationship to the snorer. Many snoring questionnaires have not been validated against relevant objective acoustic indices but, where this has been done, correlations tend to be moderate at best. More recently, psycho-acoustic techniques, focusing on relationships between acoustic stimuli and hearing sensations, have been used to develop snoring annoyance ratings, while environmental noise pollution metrics and standards have been deployed in an attempt to address potential health impacts from snoring noise pollution. Annoyance levels vary with the properties of the sound itself (eg loudness, temporal structure) and, equally importantly, with factors influencing the listener's psycho-physiological noise sensitivity (eg mood, time of day). Consequently, both inter-and intra-observer reproducibility for annoyance scores is again only moderate. There are now a number of sophisticated signal processing paradigms for identification and quantification of snore sounds. However, most are trained to recognise acoustic features based on reference sounds originally nominated as snores by a human observer. Perception of an individual sound as a snore varies with both sound and listener characteristics. Some sounds are classified as snore or non-snore with almost universal agreement, while others provoke wide disagreement. It seems that, like the proverbial duck, if it sounds like a snore, then it is a snore.",2010,2022-08-24T07:29:52Z,2022-08-24T07:29:52Z,NA,A11,NA,SUPPL. 1,8,NA,Sleep Biol.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate and compare five actigraphy scoring methods, and to quantify similarities and differences among actigraphy parameters across methods. Method(s): The study sample consisted of 18 adult remitted patients with bipolar disorder. Participants wore an actiwatch (AW-64, Phillips Respironics) on their non-dominant wrist over a mean of 7.83 (SD = 0.92) consecutive days. Concurrently, they also completed sleep diaries. Actigraphy records were processed using five different methods: the software provided automatic algorithm (A); the automatic algorithm supplemented by the event marker signaling lights out and time out of bed (AM); the sleep diary supplemented by the event marker (D); the event marker supplemented by the sleep diary (M); the visual inspection only (V). Result(s): Both similarities and differences were observed in quantified actigraphy parameters among the five scoring methods. Compared to the other four methods, the A method significantly overestimated sleep duration. It also significantly overestimated time spent in bed and wake after sleep onset compared to the AM method and to the V method. The V method significantly underestimated sleep onset latency compared to the four other methods. Sleep efficiency differed significantly across all methods. Conclusion(s): Differences among actigraphy scoring methods can be important, depending on the parameters of interest. Careful considerations should be given to factors such as patient subjective perception in completing the sleep diary and using the event maker, and the scorer's own subjective assessment during visual inspection. Replication with polysomnography is needed to further validate and compare the five scoring methods.",2010,2022-08-24T07:29:52Z,2022-08-24T07:29:52Z,NA,A357,NA,SUPPL. 1,33,NA,Sleep,NA,"24th Annual Meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC, SLEEP 2010.

A common self-report measure of sleepiness, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), was developed for adults and may use situations rarely encountered by younger individuals. the aim of this analysis was to evaluate and compare another self-report scale, the bradley sleepiness scale (BSS), for measuring sleepiness in high school and college students. Method(s): sleep, mood, and other behaviors of 146 high school seniors mean age 18 years (ages 17 - 21; 68 males) were assessed using an online survey, including the ESS, the BSS (17 items querying sleepiness), and reported school night sleep and wake patterns over the past 2 weeks. Total sleep time (TST) was computed using reported bedtime to rise time, minus sleep latency and wake after sleep onset; sleep duration (SD) was the report of usual sleep quantity on school nights. Result(s): BSS and ESS total scores were correlated (Pearson's r = 0.42, P < 0.0001). Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficients were 0.81 for the BSS and 0.72 for the ESS. TST and SD on school nights were negatively correlated with the BSS (r = -0.29, P < 0.0001; r = -0.44, P < 0.0001) and the ESS (r = -0.17, P < 0.05; r = -0.28, P < 0.001). Steiger's z test showed no significant difference between the BSS and ESS for TST correlations (z = 1.35, P = 0.18) and a trend toward significance for the SD correlations (z = 1.87, P = 0.06). Four BSS sub-scales were identified using a principal component analysis: situations requiring a high level of engagement, requiring a low level of engagement, involving social interaction, playing videogames. Conclusion(s): Cronbach's Alpha was in the acceptable range for ESS and good for BSS. Both scales were correlated with each other and with TST and SD. Further, the principal component analysis revealed that several components of sleepiness are drawn upon within the BSS.

An objective and efficient method for determining whether the person is tired could provide a valuable tool in accident prevention. In this study, we evaluated whether oculomotor responses related to pupillary light reflex and saccadic velocity can identify subjects with sleep deprivation and whether these objective values correlate with subjective feeling of sleepiness. Method(s):Thirteen normal subjects (5 male, 8 female) participated in a 4-day study. During the first two days following a full night's (8hr in bed) sleep, they underwent baseline automated oculomotor testing using the FIT-2500-Fatigue-Analyzer. Following a third full night's sleep, participants were then sleep-deprived for 28hr. Ten measurements of automated oculomotor tests were performed during the sleep deprivation period. Visually-guided saccadic velocity (SV), initial pupil diameter (PD), pupillary constriction latency (CL), and amplitude of pupil constriction (CA) were assessed using the FIT-2500-Fatigue-Analyzer. The FIT-index, which expresses the deviation of the ocular parameters from the baseline measurements, was calculated. Correlation of oculomotor parameters with the subjective Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) was performed. Result(s):We found that oculomotor measures showed a significant increase in CL (298.6 to 308.4 msec, P<0.05) and calculated FIT index (3.4 to 16.8, P<0.05) and a significant decrease in SV (64.8 to 59.6 deg/sec) during sleep deprivation. The SSS was found to significantly increase over the sleep deprivation period (2.05 to 5.05, P<0.05) and was significantly correlated with the FIT-index (r > 0.66, P<0.02). Conclusion(s):Evaluation of oculomotor responses, particularly CL and SV together with the FIT-index, might have practical applications for the assessment of an individual's state of alertness or fatigue. Correlation of the FIT-index to the SSS provides evidence for the potential usefulness of oculomotor function measurements in the detection of subjective sleepiness. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",2010,2022-08-24T07:29:52Z,2022-08-24T07:29:52Z,NA,1135-1141,NA,12,35,NA,Curr.

PPGs were obtained from subjects' fingers and backs with and without making a direct contact between the PPG sensor and their skin when they rested in a supine position on the mattress. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were measured from the subjects' limbs for reference. Clear PPG waveforms were obtained from the subjects' backs. Beat-to-beat HR derived from contactless PPG measurement was comparable to those measured from contact PPG and ECG measurements. Thus we found that contactless PPG could be captured from the subjects' backs and it was sufficient to provide accurate HR measurements. This contactless monitoring of PPG has the potential to reduce obstruction in sleep and provide clinical evaluation in sleep study.,2010,2022-08-24T07:29:52Z,2022-08-24T07:29:52Z,NA,1065-1074,NA,7,31,NA,Physiol Meas,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United Kingdom,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed11&NEWS=N&AN=603419037,physiologic monitoring; human; adult; female; male; young adult; devices; heart rate; photoelectric plethysmography; *physiology; *bed; electrocardiography; *procedures,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The mechanism of snoring is vibration of anatomical structures in the pharyngeal airway. Flutter of the soft palate accounts for the harsh aspect of the snoring sound. Natural or drug-induced sleep is required for its appearance. Snoring is subject to many influences such as body position, sleep stage, route of breathing and the presence or absence of sleep-disordered breathing. Its presentation may be variable within or between nights. While snoring is generally perceived as a social nuisance, rating of its noisiness is subjective and, therefore, inconsistent. Objective assessment of snoring is important to evaluate the effect of treatment interventions. Moreover, snoring carries information relating to the site and degree of obstruction of the upper airway. If evidence for monolevel snoring at the site of the soft palate is provided, the patient may benefit from palatal surgery. These considerations have inspired researchers to scrutinize the acoustic characteristics of snoring events. Similarly to speech, snoring is produced in the vocal tract. Because of this analogy, existing techniques for speech analysis have been applied to evaluate snoring sounds. It appears that the pitch of the snoring sound is in the low-frequency range (<500 Hz) and corresponds to a fundamental frequency with associated harmonics. The pitch of snoring is determined by vibration of the soft palate, while nonpalatal snoring is more 'noise-like', and has scattered energy content in the higher spectral sub-bands (>500 Hz). To evaluate acoustic properties of snoring, sleep nasendoscopy is often performed. Recent evidence suggests that the acoustic quality of snoring is markedly different in drug-induced sleep as compared with natural sleep. Most often, palatal surgery alters sound characteristics of snoring, but is no cure for this disorder. It is uncertain whether the perceived improvement after palatal surgery, as judged by the bed partner, is due to an altered sound spectrum. Whether some acoustic aspects of snoring, such as changes in pitch, have predictive value for the presence of obstructive sleep apnea is at present not sufficiently substantiated. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, recent results showed that the left side of the body is more prone to melanoma than the right side [D.H. Brewster, M.J. Horner, S. Rowan, P. Jelfs, E. de Vries, E. Pukkala, Left-sided excess of invasive cutaneous melanoma in six countries, Eur. J. Cancer 43 (2007) 2634-2637]. Current explanations for left-sided breast cancer include handedness [L. Titus-Ernstoff, P.A. Newcomb, K.M. Egan, et al., Left-handedness in relation to breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women, Epidemiology 11 (2000) 181-184; M.A. Kramer, S. Albrecht, R.A.

Uiterwaal, Innate left handedness and risk of breast cancer: case-cohort study, BMJ 331 (2005) 882-883], size difference, nursing preference, and brain structure. However, men are affected even more by left laterality than women, thus many of these explanations are unconvincing. Increasing rates of skin melanoma have been associated with immune-disruptive radiation from FM/TV transmitters [O Hallberg, A theory and model to explain the skin melanoma epidemic, Melanoma Res. 16 (2006) 115-118; O Hallberg, A reduced repair efficiency can explain increasing melanoma rates, Eur.

Geographical areas covered by several transmitters show higher incidences of melanoma than areas covered by one transmitter. Here we show that a high prevalence of breast cancer and melanoma on the left side of the body may be a logical consequence of sleeping in beds having mattresses containing wave-reflecting metal springs. We found that people tend to sleep for longer periods on their right side, apparently to avoid disturbance by the heartbeat. This puts the left side farther away from the field-attenuating influence of the metal springs in the mattress; thus the left side will spend, on average, more time exposed to stronger combined fields from incident and reflected waves. This hypothesis may also explain why body parts farthest away from the mattress (trunk and upper arms for men; lower limbs and hips for women) have higher melanoma rates than the sun-exposed face area. The implications of this study should promote a critical consideration of population exposure to electromagnetic fields, especially during the night. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",2010,2022-08-24T07:29:52Z,2022-08-24T07:29:52Z,NA,157-160,NA,3,17,NA,Pathophysiology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: Netherlands Publisher: Elsevier (P.O.

These beds, of several designs, are intended to reduce pressure on the body surface of immobilized patients, in order to prevent decubitus ulcers, which are often fatal. Since low-repulsion mattresses lack conventional springs, padding and air space, this system employs a polyvinyl chloride tube under the mattress, which has a 40 kHz ultrasonic transmitter and receiver at its ends. The shape of the tube is altered by body, heart and respiratory movements, which modulate the complex diffusion of the ultrasonic energy in the tube. As a result, the amplitude of the received ultrasonic signal is movement-modulated. This received signal is then demodulated and low, high and band pass filtered, to yield the three separate patient movement parameters. These are recorded and can be real-time computer analyzed, to activate alarms if the patient has not moved, or not been moved by the staff, within programmable time limits. These data may also be employed to indicate relative patient medical condition. A major system advantage is that it does not require any body-attached sensors. Copyright 2010 ISA.

The objective of this study was to develop an early warning monitor that predicts the probability that a patient can be disconnected from mechanical ventilation within the first hours after cardiac surgery and to investigate whether dynamic information of the first 4 hours of ICU stay of individual patients can improve predictions based on static admission data. Method(s): The criteria to start the weaning from mechanical ventilation are hemodynamic and respiratory stability, absence of bleeding, and normothermia. Models will be built to predict the first window of 30 minutes where these stable clinical conditions are reached. The considered prediction task was stated as follows: predict the probability that the patient will begin to satisfy the stability criteria within each of the following time frames (classes): class 1, earlier than 9 hours after admission; class 2, later than 9 hours after admission. Data from a total of 203 patients admitted to the ICU after planned coronary bypass surgery were analyzed. We selected 5 physiologic input variables that were routinely monitored in these patients and saved with a sample interval of 1 minute in the Patient Data Management System (Metavision, iMD-Soft): heart rate (bpm), systolic arterial blood pressure (mm Hg), systolic pulmonary pressure (mm Hg), blood temperature (degreeC), and oxygen saturation. Based on these 5 physiologic variables, different dynamic features were extracted: the means and standard deviations of the signals, parameters of multivariate autoregressive models, and cepstral coefficients. These sets of features served subsequently as inputs for a Gaussian process (GP) and the prediction results were compared with the case where only admission data were used for the (Table presented) classification. Gaussian process models will be compared against a logistic regression predictive model. Result(s): Table 1 gives an overview of the obtained areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (aROCs) as well as the Brier scores for each experiment with the GP. The dynamic features, especially the cepstral coefficients (aROC, 0.749; Brier score, 0.206), resulted in significantly higher performances when compared to static admission data (aROC, 0.547; Brier score, 0.247). In all cases, the GP classifier outperformed logistic regression (LOGREG), which was calculated for comparison purposes. Conclusion(s): The performance of GP models to predict respiratory weaning can be significantly improved by using advanced calculations of the dynamic properties of time series of heart rate, systolic arterial blood pressure, systolic pulmonary pressure, blood temperature, and oxygen saturation, when using aROC and Brier scores as evaluation criteria. When compared to logistic regression, GP classifier results in better performances in all cases. Dynamic analysis of data measured by patient data management systems has the potential to offer a valuable additional tool for monitoring the status of individual patients at the bedside.",2009,2022-08-24T07:29:53Z,2022-08-24T07:29:53Z,NA,e32,NA,3,24,NA,J.

Method(s): All 461 adult patients who were admitted to our 56-bed surgical ICU after scheduled cardiac surgery between the January 18 and December 4, 2007, were selected as development cohort. All data in this study were available in the computerized medical chart of the patient (Metavision, iMD-Soft). We used the following ICU admission data: age, sex, body mass index, weekday and hour of admission, APACHE II score, history of diabetes, use of temporary epicardiac pacing, presence of endocarditis, preoperative lung function, heart rate, blood pressure, baseline serum creatinine, type of surgery, and intraoperative blood loss. Three signals with a sample interval of one measurement per minute were selected for time series analysis: heart rate, systolic arterial blood pressure, and oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry (SpO2). The dynamic features of these signals were calculated using multivariate autoregressive models, cepstral coefficients, detrended fluctuation analysis results, and approximate entropy values. We used 4 hours of data of each of these signals. Models were built using a Gaussian process classifier to predict the probability of ICU discharge on the day after surgery. Three separate models were developed: a first model used only the ICU admission data, a second model used only the coefficients from the dynamic data analysis, and a third model was based on a combination of both admission data and dynamic coefficients. Models were validated in a previously unseen validation cohort of 116 patients. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (aROC) was used (Table presented) to evaluate discrimination, and the Brier score (BS) was used for calibration. The results were compared with the predictions of ICU nurses and physicians 4 hours after admission of the patient. Result(s): The results are summarized in Table 1. The dynamic data were more predictive for second-day discharge after cardiac surgery than the admission data. The combination of admission and dynamic data was not significantly better than using dynamic data alone. Discrimination of this combined model is equivalent to that of the ICU nurses but less than the ICU physicians. Conclusion(s): Dynamic information of only 3 physiologic variables (heart rate, systolic arterial blood pressure, and oxygen saturation) measured during the first few hours of ICU stay is more predictive for ICU discharge than static admission data.

Results. After bed rest, AG-treated subjects demonstrated greater orthostatic tolerance (OT) than control subjects, p = 0.012 (Stenger, 2008). Variables recorded during HDBR days were then analyzed to develop a model to predict OT before return to gravity. The variables evaluated represent control aspects of heart rate, blood pressure, spontaneous baroreflex activity, and breathing activity. From 16 available variables, 120 combinations were used to build a two variable model. The combination of high frequency spectral power of systolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure correctly classified subjects as trained or untrained 93% of the time.

A seizure prediction algorithm (SPA) typically estimates dynamical variables computed from EEG, ECoG or depth recordings, and flags an abnormal trend as a sign of impending seizure. Existing SPAs show limited specificity and are prone to false prediction. Our hypothesis is that normal state(s) of vigilance (SOV) - e.g., wakefulness, REM sleep or non-REM sleep - and transitions between these states, play a significant role in determining seizure probability and SPA performance. In order to test this hypothesis, we propose to discriminate SOV in an animal model of epilepsy and correlate SOV with seizure occurrence. Method(s): We have implemented a chronic, behaving animal model of limbic epilepsy as a test-bed for feedback seizure control strategies using polarizing low-frequency electric fields. Tetanus toxin implanted in the ventral hippocampus of rats generates spontaneous, intermittent, generalized seizures for several weeks following a latent period of 2-4 days. We have also developed methods for discrimination of instantaneous SOV from EEG and kinematic measurements in non-epileptic controls (J. Neurosci. Meth., 163:373-83, 2007). In the present work we extend this methodology, using the computational framework of the hidden Markov model (HMM), to track SOV in chronic recordings from epileptic animals and to test for characteristic SOV changes in the preseizure period. Result(s): A simple HMM, constructed using estimates of the EEG theta power fraction (4-8 Hz), and motion derived from a head-mounted MEMS accelerometer in 12 s epochs of data, was able to discriminate between non-REM sleep, REM sleep, quiet wakefulness, and active awake behavior with over 80% accuracy in epileptic animals in the latent period prior to development of any seizures. The HMM was then used to track SOV in recordings containing spontaneously recurring seizures. Examination of a sample of 42 seizures showed that seizures were more likely to occur during transitions from REM sleep (55%) than from non-REM sleep (10%) or awake behavior (35%). In a five minute period leading up to seizure onset, the probability that the animal was awake increased gradually from about 10% to 35%, suggesting that seizures in this model may accompany arousal from sleep. Similar observations are common in clinical monitoring. Comprehensive analysis of recordings from a number of animals is ongoing to investigate the precise nature of preictal SOV transitions in this epilepsy model. Conclusion(s): Quantitative correlations between SOV and seizures in epilepsy will enable improved state-dependent seizure prediction and control. Our long-term goal is to translate this approach for use in human patients. Computational models of SOV dynamics are expected to impact the understanding and treatment of epilepsy, with potential applications in sleep research and neural prosthetics as well.",2009,2022-08-24T07:29:53Z,2022-08-24T07:29:53Z,NA,477,NA,SUPPL. 11,50,NA,Epilepsia,NA,"2009 Annual Meeting of the American Epilepsy Society.

However, due to the variability of data coming from the physiologic sensors describing the state of patients, false positive alarms frequently occur. Each alarm requires review and documentation, which consumes clinicians' time, may reduce patient safety through 'alert fatigue' and makes automated physician paging infeasible. To address these issues a computerized architecture based on simple reactive intelligent agent technology has been developed and implemented in a live critical care unit to facilitate the investigation of deterministic algorithms for the improvement of the sensitivity and specificity of physiologic alarms. The initial proposed algorithm uses a combination of median filters and production rules to make decisions about what alarms to generate. The alarms are used to classify the state of patients and alerts can be easily viewed and distributed using standard network, SQL database and Internet technologies. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, a 28 day study was conducted in the University of Michigan Medical Center's 14 bed Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit. Alarms generated by patient monitors, the intelligent agent and alerts documented on patient flow sheets were compared. Significant improvements in the specificity of the physiologic alarms based on systolic and mean blood pressure was found on average to be 99% and 88% respectively. Even through significant improvements were noted based on this algorithm much work still needs to be done to ensure the sensitivity of alarms and methods to handle spurious sensor data due to patient or sensor movement and other influences. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.",2009,2022-08-24T07:29:53Z,2022-08-24T07:29:53Z,NA,21-30,NA,1,23,NA,J.

The aim of the present study was to test the response to repeated partial sleep loss through detailed focus on spectral data and parts of sleep. Design(s): The experiment involved 4 h of sleep across 5 days in the laboratory (partial sleep deprivation [PSD]), followed by 3 days of recovery sleep. PSD was achieved through a delayed bedtime. Nine individuals participated. To avoid ""laboratory monotony,"" subjects were permitted to leave the lab for a few hours each day. Measurements and results: All sleep stages and the latencies to sleep and slow wave sleep (SWS) showed a significant reduction during PSD. However, SWS and TST (total sleep time) during the first half of sleep increased gradually across days with PSD. During the first recovery sleep, SWS was significantly increased, while stage 1 and latency to stage 3 were reduced. All were back to baseline on the second night of recovery sleep. Summed spectral power during the first 3.8 h of sleep showed a gradual and robust increase (50% above baseline) in the range 1.25-7.25 Hz across days with PSD up to first recovery sleep and then returned to baseline.

The patterns of convection cells are found to depend on different operating parameters, i.e. frequency, amplitude etc. The influence of modified container geometries on the behavior of particle movement is being studied. Outward tilted container walls lead to the reversal of the direction of convection cells but only in specially modified containers.

This method is based on capacitive coupling involving the electrode, the underwear, and the skin. In order to detect ECG signal and respiratory variation individually, a differential separation filter is introduced. The filter divides an input signal into a high frequency component for narrow-band ECG detection and a low frequency component for respiratory variation detection. To evaluate the proposed method, a pilot measuring device was made and tested. As the results, we confirmed the following: (1) Respiratory variation signal obtained with our device was highly correlated (r = 0.995) with that measured simultaneously with a commercial pneumotachograph. (2) Our pilot device succeeded in measuring narrow-band ECGand respiratory variation respectively in 13 of 15 and 11 of 15 measurements of infant aging 53 to 187 days. (3) R-R interval extracted from the narrow-band ECG was 25 times more precise than that calculated from photoplethysmogram. (4) Heart rate variability extracted from the narrow-band ECG was 100 times more precise than that calculated from photoplethysmogram.

However, both the immediate availability of conventional EEG and the expertise with which it is interpreted are variable. Amplitude-integrated EEG provides simplified monitoring of cerebral function, and is rapidly gaining popularity among neonatologists, with growing use in bedside decision making and inclusion criteria for randomized clinical studies. Nonetheless, child neurologists and neurophysiologists remain cautious about relying solely on this tool and prefer interpreting conventional EEG. The present review examines the technical aspects of generating, recording, and interpreting amplitude-integrated EEG and contrasts this approach with conventional EEG. Finally, several proposed amplitude-integrated EEG classification schemes are reviewed.

At present, most of the available gait rehabilitation robot systems have been designed to support the body weight externally. For gait training to be effective, a mobile body weight support (BWS) mechanism is needed. In mobile gait training robot systems, functions such as patient path following and constant BWS are important issues, particularly in dynamic environments. In the present study, two types of robotic systems were developed for gait rehabilitation. The first is known as the mobile manipulator type and the second the mobile vehicle type. The differences between the two systems in design and control are discussed. A control algorithm based on a neural network was used to compensate for dynamic interactions, unmodeled dynamics, and disturbances by the user on the system. Both electrical and pneumatic BWS mechanisms were built and compared. The proposed BWS systems were tested experimentally for their effectiveness in gait rehabilitation while maximizing the therapeutic outcome. © 2006 IEEE.",2009,2022-08-24T07:29:54Z,2022-08-24T07:29:54Z,NA,156-166,NA,2,17,NA,IEEE Trans.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation between objective sleep parameters and the amplitudes and latencies of ERPs components N1 and P2 in a multi-assessment protocol. Method(s): Participants, 15 INS and 16 GS, underwent four consecutive nights of polysomnography recordings (N1 to N4). ERPs in the evening and upon awakening were recorded on N3 and N4, with the addition of sleep-onset recordings on N4. Auditory stimuli consisted of 'standard' and 'deviant' tones. Objective sleep measures were computed on each night [sleep efficiency (SE), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST) and sleep-onset latency (SOL)]. The amplitude and latency of N1 and P2 components were assessed for each recorded session on each night and related to measures of sleep of the same nights (N3 and N4). Result(s): Pearson's correlations between the amplitude and latency of N1 and P2 and objective sleep measures revealed that arousal levels in the evening, before going to bed seem to have an impact on subsequent sleep quality. Furthermore, the sleep quality of the previous night also appeared to have an impact on morning (daily) arousal levels. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that hyperactivation and inhibition deficits present in insomnia sufferers are directly associated with a poorer sleep quality. This highlights once again that when information processing and/or performance is assessed, the sleep quality of the night preceding the evaluation shall be documented. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It collects data from a variety of bedside monitors and produces on-line time trends of parameters defined using configurable signal processing formulas. The resulting data can be displayed in a variety of ways including time trends, histograms, cross histograms, correlations, etc. For technically minded researchers there is a plug-in mechanism facilitating registration of third party libraries of functions and analysis tools. Methods The latest version of the ICM+ software has been used in 162 severely head injured patients in the Neuro-sciences Critical Care Unit of the Addenbrooke's Cambridge University Hospital. Intracranial pressure (ICP) and invasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) were monitored routinely. Mean values of ICP, ABP, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and various indices describing pressure reactivity (PRx), pressure-volume compensation (RAP) and vascular waveforms of ICP were calculated. Error-bar chart showing reactivity index PRx versus CPP ('Optimal CPP' chart) was calculated continuously. Findings PRx showed a significant relationship with CPP (ANOVA: p<0.021) indicating loss of cerebral pressure-reactivity for low CPP (CPP < 55 mmHg) and for high CPPs (CPP>95 mmHg). Examining PRx-CPP curves in individual patients revealed that CPPopt not only varied between subjects but tended to fluctuate as the patient's state changed during the stay in the ICU. Calculation window of 6-8 h provided enough data to capture the CPPopt curve. Conclusions ICM+ software proved to be useful both academically and clinically. The complexity of data analysis is hidden inside loadable profiles thus allowing clinically minded investigators to take full advantage of signal processing engine in their research into cerebral blood and fluid dynamics. © 2008 Springer-Verlag/Wien.",2008,2022-08-24T07:29:54Z,2022-08-24T07:29:54Z,NA,145-151,NA,102,NA,NA,Acta Neurochir.

A reduction of pressure ulcer wound area is one of the most important indicators of wound healing. A wound measurement system (VISITRAKTM), which calculates the area based on simple tracings of wounds, has been developed as a practical tool for assessing wound area at the bedside. However, its accuracy has remained to be clarified in a clinical setting. This study aimed to clarify the clinical accuracy of the VISITRAK system. Design. A descriptive correlational study. Methods. Intra- and inter-rater reliability of wound measuring techniques were calculated using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) from 10 pressure ulcers. Concurrent validity was assessed, using 30 pressure ulcers, by comparing VISITRAK and digital planimetry. Assessment times for VISITRAK and digital planimetry were also compared for clinical practicality. Results. The VISITRAK reliability results showed high (0.99) ICC values. For validity, a correlation coefficient between VISITRAK and digital planimetry was 0.99. The median time to take a measurement with VISITRAK was significantly shorter than that required for digital planimetry. Conclusions. Based on our results, VISITRAK was found to have high intra- and inter-rater reliability and high validity. Relevance to clinical practice. The short measurement time with the VISITRAK system, and the ability to use it at the bedside, make it a useful, convenient device for clinical use. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2007,2022-08-24T07:29:54Z,2022-08-24T07:29:54Z,NA,1265-1269,NA,7,16,NA,J.

We undertook this study to characterize respiratory status in an SDU population, to define features of cardiorespiratory instability, and to evaluate an IMS index value that should trigger medical emergency team (MET) activation. Method(s): This descriptive, prospective, single-blinded, observational study evaluated all patients in a 24-bed SDU in a university medical center during 8 weeks from November 16, 2006, to January 11, 2007. An IMS (BioSign; OBS Medical, Carmel, Indiana) was inserted into the standard noninvasive hardwired monitoring system and used heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry to develop a single neural networked signal, or BioSign Index (BSI). Data were analyzed for cardiorespiratory instability according to BSI trigger value and local MET activation criteria. Staff were blinded to BSI data collected in 326 patients (total census). Result(s): Data for 18 248 hours of continuous monitoring were captured. Data for peripheral oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry were absent in 30% of monitored hours despite being a standard of care. Cardiorespiratory status in most patients (243 of 326 [74.5%]) was stable throughout their SDU stay, and instability in the remaining patients (83 of 326 [25%]) was exhibited infrequently. We recorded 111 MET activation criteria events caused by cardiorespiratory instability in 59 patients, but MET activation for this cause occurred in only 7 patients. All MET events were detected by BSI in advance (mean, 6.3 hours) in a bimodal distribution (>6 hours and <=45 minutes). Conclusion(s): Cardiorespiratory instability, while uncommon and often unrecognized, was preceded by elevation of the IMS index.

Bedside HIT identifies subsequent catch-up saccades after the head rotation as indirect signs of VOR deficit. Objective(s): To determine the VOR deficit and catch-up saccade characteristics in unilateral vestibular disease in response to HIT of varying accelerations. Method(s): Eye and head rotations were measured with search coils during manually applied horizontal HITs of varying accelerations in patients after vestibular neuritis (VN, n = 13) and unilatera vestibular deafferentation (UVD, n = 15) compared to normal subjects (n = 12). Result(s): Normal VOR gain was close to unity and symmetric over the entire head-acceleration range. Patients with VN and UVD showed VOR gain asymmetry, with larger ipsilesional than contralesional deficits. As accelerations increased from 750 to 6,000 degree/sec2, ipsilesional gains decreased from 0.59 to 0.29 in VN and from 0.47 to 0.13 in UVD producing increasing asymmetry. Initial catch-up saccades can occur during or after head rotation. Covert saccades during head rotation are most likely imperceptible, while overt saccades after head rotation are detectable by clinicians. With increasing acceleration, the amplitude of overt saccades in patients became larger; however, initial covert saccades also became increasingly common, occurring in up to about 70% of trials. Conclusion(s): Head impulse test (HIT) with high acceleration reveals vestibulo-ocular reflex deficits better and elicits larger overt catch-up saccades in unilateral vestibular patients. Covert saccades during head rotation, however, occur more frequently with higher acceleration and may be missed by clinicians. To avoid false-negative results, bedside HIT should be repeated to improve chances of detection.

Within this context, early identification of organ impairment is a key issue. The sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) is an expert-driven score that is widely used in European ICUs to quantify organ disorder. This work proposes a complementary data-driven approach based on adverse events, defined from commonly monitored biometrics. The aim is to study the impact of these events when predicting the risk of ICU organ failure. Material(s) and Method(s): A large database was considered, with a total of 25,215 daily records taken from 4425 patients and 42 European ICUs. The input variables include the case mix (i.e. age, diagnosis, admission type and admission from) and adverse events defined from four bedside physiologic variables (i.e. systolic blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximeter oxygen saturation and urine output). The output target is the organ status (i.e. normal, dysfunction or failure) of six organ systems (respiratory, coagulation, hepatic, cardiovascular, neurological and renal), as measured by the SOFA score. Two data mining (DM) methods were compared: multinomial logistic regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). These methods were tested in the R statistical environment, using 20 runs of a 5-fold cross-validation scheme. The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and Brier score were used as the discrimination and calibration measures. Result(s): The best performance was obtained by the ANNs, outperforming the MLR in both discrimination and calibration criteria. The ANNs obtained an average (over all organs) area under the ROC curve of 64, 69 and 74% and Brier scores of 0.18, 0.16 and 0.09 for the dysfunction, normal and failure organ conditions, respectively. In particular, very good results were achieved when predicting renal failure (ROC curve area of 76% and Brier score of 0.06). Conclusion(s): Adverse events, taken from bedside monitored data, are important intermediate outcomes, contributing to a timely recognition of organ dysfunction and failure during ICU length of stay. The obtained results show that it is possible to use DM methods to get knowledge from easy obtainable data, thus making room for the development of intelligent clinical alarm monitoring. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This review describes available static and dynamic indices used as bedside indicators of cardiac preload and fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients. Static indices (mostly derived from a pulmonary artery catheter or echocardiography) are based on measurements of cardiac pressures and volumes. Dynamic indices are based on a functional assessment of the pressure-volume relationship and the heart-lung interaction. Available data demonstrated that dynamic indices such as pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation were more reliable predictors of fluid responsiveness than static indices. Dynamic indices using non-invasive devices are also proposed and it is expected that they will be used more often in future. However, spontaneous breathing movements and arrhythmia are the major limitations to the use of dynamic indices in clinical practice. In this respect, new volumetric bedside assessment methods could represent good alternatives. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",2008,2022-08-24T07:29:55Z,2022-08-24T07:29:55Z,NA,22-30,NA,1,4,NA,J.

In particular, in the test-bed setting of reach-to-grasp actions, grip aperture is identified as a good candidate for inclusion into a parsimonious set of hand high-level features describing overall hand movement during reach-to-grasp actions. The computational model NeGOI (neural network architecture for measuring grip aperture in an observer-independent way) for extracting grip aperture in a view-independent fashion was developed on the basis of functional hypotheses about cortical areas that are involved in visual processing. An assumption built into NeGOI is that grip aperture can be measured from the superposition of a small number of prototypical hand shapes corresponding to predefined grip-aperture sizes. The key idea underlying the NeGOI model is to introduce view-independent units (VIP units) that are selective for prototypical hand shapes, and to integrate the output of VIP units in order to compute grip aperture. The distinguishing traits of the NEGOI architecture are discussed together with results of tests concerning its view-independence and grip-aperture recognition properties. The overall functional organization of NEGOI model is shown to be coherent with current functional models of the ventral visual stream, up to and including temporal area STS. Finally, the functional role of the NeGOI model is examined from the perspective of a biologically plausible architecture which provides a parsimonious set of high-level and view-independent visual features as input to mirror systems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The aims of coating range from simply masking the taste or odour of drugs to the sophisticated controlling of site and rate of drug release. The high expectations for different coating technologies have required great efforts regarding the development of reproducible and controllable production processes. Basically, improvements in coating methods have focused on particle movement, spraying systems, and air and energy transport. Thereby, homogeneous distribution of coating material and increased drying efficiency should be accomplished in order to achieve high end product quality. Moreover, given the claim of the FDA to design the end product quality already during the manufacturing process (Quality by Design), the development of analytical methods for the analysis, management and control of coating processes has attracted special attention during recent years. The present review focuses on recent patents claiming improvements in pharmaceutical coating technology and intends to first familiarize the reader with the available procedures and to subsequently explain the application of different analytical tools. Aiming to structure this comprehensive field, coating technologies are primarily divided into pan and fluidized bed coating methods. Regarding pan coating procedures, pans rotating around inclined, horizontal and vertical axes are reviewed separately. On the other hand, fluidized bed technologies are subdivided into those involving fluidized and spouted beds. Then, continuous processing techniques and improvements in spraying systems are discussed in dedicated chapters. Finally, currently used analytical methods for the understanding and management of coating processes are reviewed in detail in the last section of the review. © 2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",2008,2022-08-24T07:29:55Z,2022-08-24T07:29:55Z,NA,209-230,NA,3,2,NA,Recent Pat.

However, 'talk', 'listen' and 'standby' modes differ in the ELF (2, 8, and 217 Hz) spectral components and specific absorption rates, but no sleep study has differentiated these modes. We used a GSM900 mobile phone controlled by a base-station simulator and a test SIM card to simulate these three specific modes, transmitted at 12.5% (23 dBm) of maximum power. At weekly intervals, 10 healthy young adults, sleep restricted to 6 h, were randomly and single-blind exposed to one of: talk, listen, standby and sham (nil signal) modes, for 30 min, at 13:30 h, whilst lying in a sound-proof, lit bedroom, with a thermally insulated silent phone beside the right ear. Bipolar EEGs were recorded continuously, and subjective ratings of sleepiness obtained every 3 min (before, during and after exposure). After exposure the phone and base-station were switched off, the bedroom darkened, and a 90 min sleep opportunity followed. We report on sleep onset using: (i) visually scored latency to onset of stage 2 sleep, (ii) EEG power spectral analysis. There was no condition effect for subjective sleepiness. Post-exposure, sleep latency after talk mode was markedly and significantly delayed beyond listen and sham modes. This condition effect over time was also quite evident in 1-4 Hz EEG frontal power, which is a frequency range particularly sensitive to sleep onset. It is possible that 2, 8, 217 Hz modulation may differentially affect sleep onset. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

VEMPs were recorded with short tonebursts of 500 Hz in 14 normal subjects in 5 head positions (upright, nose up, ear up, nose down, and ear down). The three parameters analyzed were: 1) latency of p13, 2) latency of n23, and 3) corrected amplitude of p13-n23 (CA p13-n23). Results. One-way repeated measures ANOVA showed significant effects on both p13 (p=0.0245) and n23 (p<0.0001) latencies, but not on CA p13-n23. Bonferroni's post hoc test demonstrated that there were significant differences in n23 latency between the upright position and all other head positions leaning on the bed. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.",2007,2022-08-24T07:29:56Z,2022-08-24T07:29:56Z,NA,57-61,NA,1,127,NA,Acta Oto-Laryngol.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: Sweden Publisher: Informa Healthcare (69-77 Paul Street, London EC2A 4LQ, United Kingdom)",NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed10&NEWS=N&AN=46252764,analysis of variance; electromyography; article; human; priority journal; adult; female; male; normal human; human experiment; post hoc analysis; standing; frequency modulation; amplitude modulation; latent period; auditory stimulation; *evoked muscle response; *head position; *pure tone audiometry; *vestibular evoked myogenic potential; auditory threshold,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Prospective, convenience sample. SETTING: Cardiac surgical progressive care unit in a 629-bed, not-for-profit, tertiary-care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Status post-cardiac-surgery patients (n = 36) during their first postoperative ambulation. INTERVENTIONS: None. PROTOCOL: Randomization was used for digit and hand selection, and all 3 devices were used continuously during ambulation. Data on dropouts, false alarms, and correlation with heart rate were recorded. We continuously measured arterial oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry during ambulation with all 3 devices. RESULT(S): Pairwise comparisons indicated significant differences among the 3 devices for data dropout and false alarm. In repeated-measures analysis, the Nellcor N-3000 had the greatest likelihood of data dropout (odds ratio of 31.9 to Masimo and 5.6 to Philips, at the 95% confidence interval). However, the converse was true for false alarms; the Masimo had the most false alarms, with an odds ratio of 17.9 to Nellcor and 2.3 to Philips, at the 95% confidence interval. There were also significantly more dropouts with all 3 devices when readings were taken on a hand on an arm from which a radial graft had been taken (p = 0.004). For heart-rate correlation, the mean absolute difference among the 3 devices was similar: Philips = 4.3 beats/min, Masimo = 5.1 beats/min, and Nellcor = 3.0 beats/min. CONCLUSION(S): There are significant differences among the 3 devices with regard to dropout and false alarms. High numbers of dropouts are problematic because no pulse-oximetry patient information is available during dropout. However, false alarms are even more problematic, because they desensitize clinicians to alarms and call into question the accuracy of displayed data. While our data highlight the statistical differences between the studied oximeters, the clinical implications of these differences warrant further study. © 2006 Daedalus Enterprises.",2006,2022-08-24T07:29:56Z,2022-08-24T07:29:56Z,NA,29-35,NA,1,51,NA,Respir.

A bedside viscoelastic test - Sonoclot - was used together with coagulation, liver and hemolysis laboratory analyses in three parturients with the HELLP syndrome up to 10 days postpartum. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of this multivariate problem and to visualize this process in a two-dimensional plot. It was possible to follow changes in these variables over time and to show how they changed in relation to 10 typical healthy parturients with normal laboratory and Sonoclot values as well as 20 simulated patients with hypo- or hypercoagubility. The effects of emergency delivery, correction of low plasma-antithrombin with plasma and antithrombin factor concentrate, plasma exchange and individualized dosages of low molecular weight heparin to counteract postpartum Sonoclot detected hypercoagulation were evaluated. The efficiency of each treatment strategy was visualized in the PCA plot by movement towards an area with normocoagulation. In conclusion, PCA of viscoelastic and laboratory coagulation analysis data facilitated the detection of both hypo- and hypercoagulative events and represents an alternative way to evaluate treatment strategies in patients with complex coagulative disorders, like the HELLP syndrome. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.",2005,2022-08-24T07:29:56Z,2022-08-24T07:29:56Z,NA,247-252,NA,4,18,NA,J.

The system consisted of eight polyvinylidene fluoride cable sensors, charge amplifiers and measuring software, together with an analogue-to-digital converter unit. The cable sensors were horizontally embedded into a textile sheet on a bed surface covering the upper half of the body. The digital infinite impulse response filters were constructed to extract cardiorespiratory signals from displacement of the sensors. The system software automatically searched the optimum sensor(s) based on the power of the respective filter outputs. Then, the system obtained the 5 s average HR and 15 s average RR by measuring the intervals between the peaks of the respective autocorrelation functions of the filtered output. If the subject changed his posture, the system captured the image of the body position as a time stamp using a CCD camera. To show the validity of this method, the HR and RR obtained by this monitor were compared with those simultaneously measured using respiratory flow and an electrocardiogram. The results showed that the mean frame-by-frame difference ranged from -1.2 to 0.2 beats min(-1) for the HR and, for RR, ranged from -0.8 to 1.4 breath min(-1) during the short-term recordings. Similar differences were obtained during the first 2 h of overnight recordings. The proposed system is feasible for the combined long-term monitoring of a person's RR and HR with sleep posture changes and may be helpful for practical use in the home.",2005,2022-08-24T07:29:57Z,2022-08-24T07:29:57Z,NA,716-724,NA,6,43,NA,Med Biol Eng Comput,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United Kingdom,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed9&NEWS=N&AN=44694678,physiology; article; human; adult; validation study; signal processing; sleep; *monitoring; electronics; *heart rate; home care; *movement (physiology); body posture; *respiratory function; instrumentation,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

No clear difference in sleep structure was observed between the head-down and horizontal conditions, except for a slight decrease in Stage 4 for head-down. Both subjective and objective daytime vigilance, P300, and the simple RT task showed no statistical difference, although tracking performance on the dual task showed deterioration at 10:00 for the head-down condition.

This approach is compared with two logistic regression (LR) models: the prognostic model used in most of the European ICUs, based on the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II), and a LR that uses the same input variables of the ANN model. Material(s) and Method(s): A large dataset was considered, encompassing forty two ICUs of nine European countries. The recorded features of each patient include the final outcome, the case mix (e.g. age) and the intermediate outcomes, defined as the daily averages of the out of range values of four biometrics (e.g. heart rate). The SAPS II score requires 17 static variables (e.g. serum sodium), which are collected within the first day of the patient's admission. A nonlinear least squares method was used to calibrate the LR models while the ANNs are made up of multilayer perceptrons trained by the RPROP algorithm. A total of 13,164 adult patients were randomly divided into training (66%) and test (33%) sets. The two methods were evaluated in terms of receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Result(s): The event based models predicted the outcome more accurately than the currently used SAPS II model (P<0.05), with ROC areas within the ranges 83.9-87.1% (ANN) and 82.6-85.2% (LR) versus 80% (LR SAPS II). When using the same inputs, the ANNs outperform the LR (improvement of 1.3-2%). Conclusion(s): Better prognostic models can be achieved by adopting low cost and real-time intermediate outcomes rather than static data. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The reliability metric is scored out of 100 for each sensor where high scores denote more reliable data. Once respiratory rates were calculated, the mean reliability metric determined the estimate reliability. Nocturnal data from a male and female participant was analyzed.

One major risk factor of the sitting position for neurosurgery is air embolism, especially in patients with persistent foramen ovale (PFO). The first aim of this prospective study was to evaluate a bedside method for detecting PFO using transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) with contrast medium. A second aim was to address intraoperative monitoring, patient positioning and the occurrence and clinical relevance of air embolism. Methods. Ninety patients with a mean age of 56.5 yr (range 14-81 yr) undergoing surgery in sitting position were investigated by TCD with contrast agent to detect functional PFO, that is PFO that can be provoked with a Valsalva manoeuvre. In patients in whom TCD was not possible, transcranial duplex sonography, duplex sonography of the carotid artery at the neck or transoesophageal ECG was performed. Results. In 26 patients PFO was detected. Thirteen of them presented a persistent PFO with high-intensity transient signal in both middle cerebral arteries without Valsalva manoeuvre. The intraoperative positioning in these patients was adapted to the risk for a paradoxical air embolism, although, after surgical recommendations, three patients with a persistent PFO underwent surgery in sitting position. Intraoperative air embolisms were seen in 8 of 80 patients in sitting or semi-sitting position with air aspirable through the central venous catheter. Conclusion. To address the risk of a paradoxical air embolism, especially in patients undergoing surgery in sitting position, preoperative detection of PFO is advisable. If surgery is performed in seated PFO patients, additional monitoring and special care are warranted. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",2006,2022-08-24T07:29:57Z,2022-08-24T07:29:57Z,NA,467-472,NA,4,96,NA,Br.

Ten healthy Japanese males participated in this study. EMG activities of both the right masseter and bilateral suprahyoid muscles were recorded with a portable EMG-recording unit. At midnight, the subject was asked to lie on a bed after complete preparation with surface electrodes. After maximal clenching and jaw-opening effort (100% maximum voluntary contribution), the subject was allowed to fall asleep. In the first half of the night, EMG activities were recorded for about three hours of sleep without nasal obstruction. In the second half of the night, EMG activities were recorded for about three hours of sleep with nasal obstruction. In both muscles, there were no significant changes in either the maximal EMG activities or the number of events beyond 40% MVC with nasal obstruction. But in an evaluation based on the distribution of muscle activities, the EMG activity of the masseter muscle tended to decrease (P = .07) and that of the suprahyoid muscles increased significantly (P = .02) with nasal obstruction. These results suggest that nasal obstruction could modulate the activities of the masseter and suprahyoid muscles during sleep.",2003,2022-08-24T07:29:58Z,2022-08-24T07:29:58Z,NA,151-157,NA,2,73,NA,Angle Orthod,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed8&NEWS=N&AN=36785723,electromyography; physiology; article; human; adult; male; pathophysiology; signal processing; time; mandible; *sleep; movement (physiology); muscle contraction; nonparametric test; *masseter muscle; *neck muscle; *nose obstruction,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Design(s): Subjects were studied in a 2-day protocol after screening for sleep disorders. The first night was a baseline sleep recording that was followed by a nap the next day at one of the following times: 900, 1200, 1500, 1800 with the nap order varied between subjects. Sleep was then recorded on the postnap night with the baseline bedtime schedule. Subjects completed all 4 nap conditions. Setting(s): A 4-bed sleep research laboratory. Each subject slept in a separate bedroom. Intervention(s): Not applicable. Participant(s): Subjects were young normal (YNs, mean age 22.4 yrs) and elderly normal (ENs, mean age 71.4 yrs) adults. Measurements and Results: Electroencephalography was recorded continuously during baseline, nap, and postnap sleep. Fast Fourier transform and period-amplitude analysis and visual scoring were performed. Delta power/min and period-amplitude integrated amplitude/min were significantly lower in EN than YN subjects. Both measures declined linearly across NREM periods and increased linearly across naps in the two age groups. The linear slopes for absolute power and integrated amplitude were significantly flatter in the elderly. However, when normalized to each individual subject's baseline rate of delta production, the slopes of the ENs closely approximated those of the YNs. Conclusion(s): The observation of linear changes in delta across NREM periods and daytime naps contradicts the exponential assumptions of the two-process model. The similarity of the normalized slopes shows that waking and sleep exert the same proportionate change in NREM delta in YNs and ENs. This raises the possibility that homeostatic drive is similar in the two groups despite different rates of absolute delta production. The data here, taken in association with other findings, lead us to hypothesize that NREM delta is specifically homeostatic for the neuronal systems that underlie consciousness.",2003,2022-08-24T07:29:58Z,2022-08-24T07:29:58Z,NA,192-200,NA,2,26,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: United States Publisher: American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2510 N.

We therefore performed computer measurement of EMD in young and elderly normal subjects. Design(s): Sleep electroencephalogram and electrooculogram were recorded in each subject on 4 nonconsecutive baseline nights. Eye movement density in the elderly subjects was compared to that in young adults. Setting(s): A sleep research laboratory with 4 separate bedrooms. Intervention(s): Not applicable. Participant(s): Subjects were 19 young normal adults and 19 elderly normal adults. Measurements and Results: Digitized electrooculograms were analyzed with the extensively validated zero-cross period-amplitude module of PASS PLUS software. The EMD was measured as 0.3 to 2 Hz integrated amplitude per 20-second stage of rapid eye movement sleep. Eye-movement incidence was the number of half waves. Eye-movement amplitude was the sum of peak-trough excursions (curve length) in the average half wave. We also counted visually the number of 2-second epochs with eye movements for 1 baseline night in both groups. The EMD in the elderly subjects was substantially and significantly lower than in the young subjects. Visual scoring of EMD on 1 baseline night confirmed the statistically significant difference between age groups. Period-amplitude analysis revealed that a lower eye-movement incidence rather than reduced amplitude caused the lower EMD in the elderly. The EMD was significantly correlated within subjects across the nonconsecutive baseline nights in both groups; in both, subjects' EMD average across 2 nights provided a correlation greater than .90 with the 4-night mean. Conclusion(s): The incidence of eye movements during rapid eye movement sleep is substantially reduced in the elderly. We hypothesize that this reduction is due to degenerative (aging) rather than developmental brain changes. The correlation analysis indicates that EMD is a reasonably stable individual trait in both young and elderly adults. These results encourage normative studies of EMD over a wider age span and continued exploration of the relation of EMD to cognitive function in the elderly.",2003,2022-08-24T07:29:58Z,2022-08-24T07:29:58Z,NA,973-977,NA,8,26,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: United States Publisher: American Academy of Sleep Medicine (2510 N.

A computer-based system was developed for the implementation, tuning and clinical assessment of neuroprosthetic controllers, using off-the-shelf hardware and software. The computer system turned a Pentium III PC running Windows NT into a non-dedicated, real-time system for the control of neuroprostheses. Software execution (written using the high-level programming languages LabVIEW and MATLAB) was divided into two phases: training and real-time control. During the training phase, the computer system collected input/output data by stimulating the muscles and measuring the muscle outputs in real-time, analysed the recorded data, generated a set of training data and trained an artificial neural network (ANN)-based controller. During real-time control, the computer system stimulated the muscles using stimulus pulsewidths predicted by the ANN controller in response to a sampled input from an external command source, to provide independent control of hand grasp and wrist posture. System timing was stable, reliable and capable of providing muscle stimulation at frequencies up to 24Hz. To demonstrate the application of the test-bed, an ANN-based controller was implemented with three inputs and two independent channels of stimulation. The ANN controller's ability to control hand grasp and wrist angle independently was assessed by quantitative comparison of the outputs of the stimulated muscles with a set of desired grasp or wrist postures determined by the command signal. Controller performance results were mixed, but the platform provided the tools to implement and assess future controller designs. © IFMBE: 2004.",2004,2022-08-24T07:29:58Z,2022-08-24T07:29:58Z,NA,754-761,NA,6,42,NA,Med.

As such, the technique has facilitated discovery of ischemia-induced excitotoxic glutamate overflow (Benveniste H, Drejer J, Schousboe A, Diemer NH, 1987, Regional cerebral glucose phosphorylation and blood flow after insertion of a microdialysis fiber through the dorsal hippocampus in the rat. J. Neurochem., 49, 729-734) and adenosinergic sleep drive (Porkka-Heiskanen T, Strecker RE, Thakkar M, Bjorkum AA, Greene RW, McCarley RW, 1997, Adenosine: a mediator of the sleep-inducing effects of prolonged wakefulness. Science, 276 (5316), 1265-1268); and is proving essential for clinical monitoring of glutamate and cellular metabolites in stroke and head trauma (Sarrafzadeh AS, Sakowitz OW, Kiening KL, Benndorf G, Lanksch WR, Unterberg AW. Bedside microdialysis: a tool to monitor cerebral metabolism in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients? Crit. Care Med. 2002, 30 (5): 1062-1070). Study of the origin of extrasynaptic glutamate sampled with microdialysis has advanced understanding of extrasynaptic signal processing (Baker DA, Xi ZX, Shen H, Swanson CJ, Kalivas PW. The origin and neuronal function of in vivo nonsynaptic glutamate. J. Neurosci. 2002, 22 (20): 9134-9141; Baker DA, McFarland K, Lake RW, Shen H, Tang XC, Toda S, Kalivas PW, 2003, Neuroadaptations in cystine-glutamate exchange underlie cocaine relapse. Nat. Neurosci., 6, 743-749) in the CNS. Microdialysis studies furthermore demonstrate that synaptic pools of some neurotransmitters spill into the extrasynaptic space. For this reason, microdialysis has provided a window into the synaptic pool that has significantly advanced understanding of neurotransmitter control of behavior (Tanda G, Pontieri FE, Di Chiara G, 1997, Cannabinoid and heroin activation of mesolimbic dopamine transmission by a common mu1 opioid receptor mechanism. Science, 276, 2048-2050). Nonetheless, ability to sample synaptic pools of neurotransmitters is limited. Here we summarize evidence that microdialysis often fails to sample synaptic pools of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and GABA because of rapid clearance and limited diffusion of these neurotransmitters from the synapse. Moreover, we consider means to move the dialysis membrane closer to the synapse to facilitate sampling of the synaptic pool of these neurotransmitters by minimizing tissue trauma, decreasing probe size and increasing temporal resolution. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To test the hypothesis that exposure to simulated microgravity significantly alters autonomic nervous control and, thus, contributes to increased incidence of OI, we employed the cardiovascular system identification (CSI) technique to evaluate quantitatively parasympathetic and sympathetic regulation of heart rate (HR). The CSI method analyzes second-to-second fluctuations in noninvasively measured HR, arterial blood pressure, and instantaneous lung volume. The coupling mechanisms between these signals are characterized by using a closed-loop model. Parameters reflecting parasympathetic and sympathetic responsiveness with regard to HR regulation can be extracted from the identified coupling mechanisms. We analyzed data collected from 29 human subjects before and after 16 days of head-down-tilt bed rest (simulated microgravity). Statistical analyses showed that parasympathetic and sympathetic responsiveness was impaired by bed rest. A lower sympathetic responsiveness and a higher parasympathetic responsiveness measured before bed rest identified individuals at greater risk of OI before and after bed rest.

Material and methods - We studied 37 lepromatous leprosy patients (mean age: 38 +/- 17 years, range 23-62 years, 20 females and 17 males) and 35 age-matched healthy subjects (mean age: 34.19 +/- 12.74 years, range 24-48 years, 20 females and 15 males). Non-invasive bedside tests (orthostatic test, Valsalva ratio), R-R interval variation (RRIV) during at rest and deep breathing, the SSR latency and amplitude from both palms, and nerve conduction parameters were studied in all the subjects. Results - The mean values of RRIV in leprosy patients during at rest [mean RRIV in patients, 17.42 +/- 8.64% vs controls, 22.71 +/- 3.77% (P < 0.05)] and during deep breathing [mean RRIV in patients, 21.64 +/- 9.08% vs controls, 30.70 +/- 5.99% (P < 0.005)] was significantly lower compared with the controls. The mean latency of SSR in leprosy patients [mean SSR latency in patients, 1.72 +/- 1.13 ms vs controls, 1.30 +/- 0.41 ms (P < 0.05)] was significantly prolonged compared with the controls. The mean amplitude of SSR in leprosy patients [mean SSR amplitude in patients, 0.54 +/- 0.57 muV vs controls, 1.02 +/- 0.56 muV (P > 0.05)] was smaller compared with the controls, but this difference was not significant. The mean Valsalva ratio in leprosy patients [mean in patients, 1.11 +/- 0.13 vs controls, 1.16 +/- 0.07 (P > 0.05)] was smaller compared with the controls, but not statistically significant. The mean difference of systolic and diastolic blood pressure between supine rest and during standing in leprosy patients were higher compared with the controls [mean systolic pressure in patients, 7 +/- 6 mmHg vs controls, 6 +/- 8 mmHg (P > 0.05) and mean diastolic pressure in patients, 3 +/- 3 mmHg vs controls, 3 +/- 2 mmHg (P > 0.05)], but they did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, lower RRIV and the prolonged SSR latencies in leprosy patients were closely correlated to some parameters of sensorimotor nerve conduction and each other [median nerve distal latency and RRIV, r = -0.67 (P < 0.05), ulnar nerve distal latency and RRIV, r = -0.59 (P < 0.05), RRIV and SSR latency, r= -0.33 (P < 0.02)]. These data indicate that leprosy patients have the functional abnormalities of ANS.

Twelve young men participated in a 20-day bed rest study. Subjects were divided into a non-training group (BRCon) and a strength-training group (BRTr). The training comprised dynamic calf-raise and leg-press exercises. Before and after bed rest, subjects performed maximal contractions and steady submaximal isometric contractions of the ankle extensor muscles and of the knee extensor muscles (2.5-10% of maximal torque). Maximal torque decreased for both the ankle extensors (9%, P < 0.05) and knee extensors (16%, P < 0.05) in BRCon but not in BRTr. For the ankle extensors, the coefficient of variation (CV) for torque increased in both groups (P < 0.05), with a greater amount (P < 0.05) in BRCon (88%) compared with BRTr (41%). For the knee extensors, an increase in the CV for torque was observed only in BRCon (22%). The increase in the CV for torque in BRCon accompanied the greater changes in electromyogram amplitude of medial gastrocnemius (122%) and vastus lateralis (59%) compared with BRTr (P < 0.05). The results indicate that fluctuations in torque during submaximal contractions of the extensor muscles in the leg increase after bed rest and that strength training counter-acted the decline in performance. The response varied across muscle groups. Alterations in muscle activation may lead to an increase in fluctuations in motor output after bed rest.",2003,2022-08-24T07:29:58Z,2022-08-24T07:29:58Z,NA,1485-1492,NA,4,95,NA,J. Appl.

The NOC.watch device consists of a credit-card size device contained within an adhesive ""patch"" and worn on the thigh continuously for many days. The patch is small, wireless, disposable, waterproof, shockproof, and unobtrusive. When a patient's leg becomes weight-bearing (such as when a patient gets out of bed or stands up unassisted), the receiver emits an audible signal which both alerts the patient to sit down and also summons a caregiver. Design(s): A crossover design was used to compare the fall rate of patients while wearing the NOC.watch device with the fall rate while not wearing it. Patients (n = 47) wore the device for one week, and were monitored for fall activity before, during, and after this week. The three time periods were referred to as the ""Pre,"" ""During,"" and ""Post"" periods, respectively. Participant(s): The study was conducted between November 1, 2000, and April 1, 2001, in the Medicare unit of a skilled nursing facility in northern California. Forty-seven patients admitted to the unit with a fall risk assessment (FRA) score of at least 6 were entered into the study, with a mean FRA of 11.4. Measurements: The main outcome measure was fall rate per 100 patient days. Qualitative observations of adverse effects on skin integrity, degree of staff and patient acceptance of the system, and lack of false alarms are also reported. Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations was used for analysis of fall rates. Result(s): Forty-seven patients wore the device. Total number of patient-days of observation were 273, 299, and 497 in the Pre, During, and Post periods, respectively, for a total of 1,069 days of observation. These patients had 11 falls in the Pre period (4.0 falls per 100 days), 1 fall in the During period (0.3 falls per 100 days) and 17 falls in the Post period (3.4 falls per 100 days). This 91% reduction in fall rate while wearing the NOC.watch is statistically significant with P = 0.02. False alarms were qualitatively reported to be low or nonexistent, and patient and caregiver acceptance of the device was reported to be high. No adverse effects on skin integrity were noted. Cognitively impaired patients, who have difficulty remembering to call for assistance, appeared to respond particularly well to the device alarm. Conclusion(s): The prototype NOC.watch device appears to have a large impact on reducing fall risk in nursing home patients, with minimal adverse effects. However, due to the lack of an equivalent control group, these results should be confirmed with a larger, randomized, controlled study to better estimate the true magnitude of the effect of the NOC.watch device on fall rates.",2002,2022-08-24T07:29:58Z,2022-08-24T07:29:58Z,NA,377-382,NA,6,3,NA,J.

Method(s): Ten male subjects slept in the laboratory for 6 consecutive nights. The first 2 nights were undisturbed. The 3rd night was considered as baseline. During the 4th and 5th nights, selective SWS deprivation was obtained by means of acoustic stimulation. The 6th night was a recovery. The data reported here were collected during the baseline and the recovery night. Subjects were awakened 3 times: after 2 h, 5 h (nocturnal awakenings) and 7.5 h (final morning awakening) of sleep, respectively. All the awakenings were carried out from stage 2. The AEP recordings were carried out in bed, while subjects were performing a simple auditory reaction time task. Result(s): The amplitude of the N1-P2 complex decreased upon the first awakening of the baseline night as compared to pre-sleep wakefulness levels; during the recovery night, the decrease of N1-P2 amplitude was present also upon the second and final awakening. N1 latency increased upon the two nocturnal awakenings regardless of the night, while P2 latency was not affected. Moreover, the N1-P2 amplitude increased during recovery at the frontal midline derivation as compared to baseline, while it decreased at Pz and Oz. Conclusion(s): The N1-P2 amplitude and, to a lesser extent, the N1 latency, are sensitive in showing a state of brain deactivation during the sleep-wake transition. The decrease of N1-P2 amplitude at the parieto-occipital locations during recovery is coherent with the hypothesis of a functional link between SWS amount and cortical hypoarousal upon awakening. The unexpected increase of the same variable at Fz can be interpreted as the effect of a compensatory effort of the frontal areas for the increased homeostatic drive for sleep during the recovery night. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Persons with this disease, which is characterized by behavioral disorders, are becoming increasingly older and more dependent. As a result of this, there are a number of problems connected with their stay in a nursing home or special care unit, such as the additional burden the nursing staff or caregivers, management of the security factor, responsibility and workload. Their condition necessitates constant surveillance on the part of family members or professional staff. In this article, a multisensor system has been described, which provides continuous monitoring during the night of the elderly person in his/her hospital room. Over the period in question, the passive infrared sensor system records every movement of the elderly person. At the end of the surveillance period, the artificial intelligence program processes the stored data and then displays the results either in the form of a three-dimensional histogram, or as a list with all movements (apart from those in bed involving less than three movements) noted together with the time, duration and contextual comment. This system alerts the caregivers by sounding an alarm if a person falls or tries to run away. It is therefore useful at several levels: in a hospital environment, in a nursing home, in a private home, and as a research tool. © 2001 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.",2001,2022-08-24T07:29:59Z,2022-08-24T07:29:59Z,NA,25-30,NA,1,22,NA,ITBM-RBM,NA,La mise en place d'une technologie pour observer le comportement nocturne des personnes agees en institution,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,French,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Place: France Publisher: Elsevier Masson SAS (62 rue Camille Desmoulins, Issy les Moulineaux Cedex 92442, France)",NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed7&NEWS=N&AN=32193079,artificial intelligence; article; human; technology; nursing home; night; home care; *patient monitoring; *Alzheimer disease/dm [Disease Management],NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The method measures quality of care (Q) based upon the accuracy of prediction of length-of-stay for the hospital, and of community length-of-stay for the community, each corrected for the severity of illness of the average patient. When Q in the hospital equals Q in the community, there is no net movement of patients from one phase of care to the other, analogous to a zero electromotive force, and the census at that point is the minimum number of beds (22 beds/100,000 population). When patients in the community were least ill, relative to the hospital then hospital bed census is at its optimum (31 beds/100,000) given current resources and technology. In studying specific diagnosis groups with the same methodology the authors found that patients with schizophrenia having the benefit of clozapine for most of the study period had a Q averaged over 7 years that was nearly equal in both hospital and community settings. This explains the perception that tertiary psychiatric hospitals comprised mostly of patients with schizophrenia can downsize significantly. However, affective disorders and ""borderline"" personality disorders clearly benefit from structured hospital care with specialized experienced staff.

Results showed that, during the experimental days, there were changes in the amplitude of the overt temperature rhythm and in the relative amounts of out-of-bed and in-bed activity, both of which indicated an interaction between endogenous and exogenous components of the rhythm. However, the amplitude and the amount of overlap were not significantly different on the control days (when endogenous and exogenous components remained synchronized) and those experimental days when endogenous and exogenous components were only transiently synchronized; also, the amplitudes of purified temperature rhythms did not change significantly during the experimental days in spite of changes in the relationship between the endogenous and exogenous components.

Our goals are: (i) to enhance the original search location algorithm in order to permit on-line flow visualization and (ii) to extend RPT to very fast solids flows, such as those encountered in circulating fluidized beds (particle velocities higher than a few m s-1). The potential of neural networks for on-line and real-time visualization of particle movements in multiphase reactors will be illustrated. The original least-squares search location algorithm (Larachi et al., 1994) has been replaced with an enhanced algorithm which uses a three-layer feed forward neural network. The results obtained from the two algorithms for particle tracking in a three-phase fluidized bed reactor are compared. The RPT system employs 8 NaI(TI) scintillation detectors to study the movement of solid particles in chemical reactors. The performance of the system was investigated using particles containing the radioisotopes 46Sc (gamma-ray energy 1005 keV), 99Mo (gamma-ray energy 140 keV) and 198Au (gamma-ray energy 412 keV). The three-dimensional spatial resolution was measured in empty and water-filled tubes, simulating highly diluted and dense media. The best results were obtained using 198Au with which the particle can be located to within 7 mm in water and 9 mm in air 100 times s-1.",1997,2022-08-24T07:29:59Z,2022-08-24T07:29:59Z,NA,225-235,NA,2,48,NA,APPL.

They therefore differ from conventional monitors in aiming to extract relevant timing and magnitude information from the morphology of the FECG rather than simply the RR interval and hence heart rate. An intrapartum monitor such as this has been successfully developed by ourselves. This paper describes the early results obtained whilst attempting to extend this form of monitoring forward into the antenatal period. In order to achieve this the FECG must be acquired via surface electrodes placed on the maternal abdomen, which yields a signal containing the FECG amidst a number of noise sources. Our investigations into the feasibility of 'antenatal abdominal FECG analysis' have been on two fronts. The first has been to produce a bedside monitor similar in function to our intrapartum device, whilst the second has been to address the possibility of performing such monitoring in ambulant subjects. At present the antenatal bedside monitor has successfully extracted and processed the FECG in approximately 75% of the cases studied, with subjects ranging from 20 weeks through to term having been monitored. We also have demonstrated the feasibility of the long term monitoring of maternal and fetal heart rate using a portable instrument.",1996,2022-08-24T07:29:59Z,2022-08-24T07:29:59Z,NA,43-53,NA,1,24,NA,J.

Heart rate, arterial pressure, radial flow, thoracic fluid impedance and central venous pressure were recorded from nine volunteers before and after simulated microgravity, produced by 20 hours of 6 degrees head down bedrest plus furosemide. Spectral powers increased after simulated microgravity in the low frequency region (centered at about 0.03 Hz) in arterial pressure, heart rate and radial flow, and decreased in the respiratory frequency region (centered at about 0.25 Hz) in heart rate. Reduced heart rate power in the respiratory frequency region indicates reduced parasympathetic influence on the heart. A concurrent increase in the low frequency power in arterial pressure, heart rate, and radial flow indicates increased sympathetic influence. These results suggest that the baseline autonomic balance in cardiovascular regulation is shifted towards increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic influence after exposure to short-term simulated microgravity.",1995,2022-08-24T07:29:59Z,2022-08-24T07:29:59Z,NA,201-214,NA,3,30,NA,Integr Physiol Behav Sci,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,English,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States,NA,NA,http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&PAGE=reference&D=emed5&NEWS=N&AN=125132199,blood pressure; physiology; article; human; adult; male; hemodynamics; heart rate; *monitoring; Non-NASA Center; *signal processing; *weightlessness; body posture; Fourier analysis; *adaptation; instrumentation; *cardiovascular function; adrenergic system; cholinergic system; diuresis; electrolyte balance; NASA Center JSC; NASA Discipline Cardiopulmonary,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A gait and locomotion analysis with EMG on treadmill,Sportverletzung Sportschaden : Organ der Gesellschaft fur Orthopadisch-Traumatologische Sportmedizin,NA,0932-0555,NA,NA,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are considered of high prevalence in sports medicine and are of socio-economical relevance. Indications for operative treatment and the ability for physical activity after ACL injuries are discussed controversially. Although it is known that the ACL has neurosensory functions, no test system has been developed which takes this biological function into account. The first goal of this study was to determine the neurosensory function after ACL reconstruction, and the second goal was to develop predictive markers for functional results after surgery. 20 healthy athletes (10 male, 10 female) (control group) and twenty ACL deficient patients (10 male, 10 female) (study group) were included in a prospective, controlled study. Electromyograms (EMG) were performed under defined load conditions of the knee. Important results of our study are: 1. Previously described parameters can be reproduced with EMG techniques. Their validity was proved. Typical contraction patterns (m. quadriceps, hamstrings, m. gastrocnemius) for defined load conditions can be recorded. 2. Statistically significant differences can be shown between the control group and the study group as well as between the two legs (injured/noninjured) of the same patient in the study group. 3. The results suggest that the diminished innervation of the m. biceps femoris and m. gastrocnemius in down-ramp-running as an important parameter for ACL deficiency. 4. Distinct differences of innervation patterns of the muscles, which stabilise the knee in downramp walking suggest that despite a subjective stability, altered load conditions may result. Innervation patterns seem to vary from individual to individual. 5. Concluding from our findings, we suggest that clinical methods should be developed to allow a patient-specific assessment of physical activity.",1994,2022-08-24T07:29:59Z,2022-08-24T07:29:59Z,NA,16-24,NA,1,8,NA,Sportverletz Sportschaden,NA,Die Bedeutung der neuromuskularen Koordination fur die sportliche Belastbarkeit des Kniegelenkes nach vorderen Kreuzbandverletzungen.

Inan,Estimation of Tidal Volume Using Load Cells on a Hospital Bed,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,NA,2168-2208,10.1109/JBHI.2022.3141209,NA,"Although respiratory failure is one of the primary causes of admission to intensive care, the importance placed on measurement of respiratory parameters is commonly overshadowed compared to cardiac parameters. With the increased demand for unobtrusive yet quantifi- able respiratory monitoring, many technologies have been proposed recently. However, there are challenges to be addressed for such technologies to enable widespread use. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using load cell sensors embedded on a hospital bed for monitoring respi- ratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (TV). We propose a globalized machine learning (ML)-based algorithm for estimating TV without the requirement of subject-specific calibration or training. In a study of 15 healthy subjects performing respiratory tasks in four different postures, the outputs from four load cell channels and the reference spirometer were recorded simultaneously. A signal processing pipeline was implemented to extract features that capture respira- tory movement and the respiratory effects on the cardiac (i.e., ballistocardiogram, BCG) signals. The proposed RR estimation algorithm achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.6 breaths per minute (brpm) against the ground truth RR from the spirometer. The TV estimation results demonstrated that combining all three axes of the low- frequency force signals and the BCG heartbeat features best quantifies the respiratory effects of TV.

A prospective pilot study was conducted with 33 participants admitted to a long-term care facility between August 10 and 25, 2020. During the pilot study, we collected 560 cases that included 33 clinical variables and the survey items from the short confusion assessment method (S-CAM), and developed a mobile-based application. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including four rule-mining algorithms (C4.5, CBA, MCAR, and LEM2) and four other statistical learning algorithms (LR, ANNs, SVMs with three kernel functions, and random forest), were validated by paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on both macro-averaged F1 and weighted average F1-measures during the 10-times stratified 2-fold cross-validation. The LEM2 algorithm achieved the best prediction performance (macro-averaged F1-measure of 49.35%; weighted average F1-measure of 96.55%), correctly identifying adult patients at delirium risk. In the pairwise comparison between predictive powers observed from independent models, the LEM2 model showed a medium or large effect size between 0.4925 and 0.8766 when compared with LR, ANN, SVM with RBF, and MCAR models. We have confirmed that acute consciousness in S-CAM assessment is closely associated with different predictors for screening three psychomotor behaviors of delirium: 1) education level, dementia type or its level, sleep disorder, dehydration, and infection in mixed-type delirium; 2) gender, education level, dementia type, dehydration, bedsores, and foley catheter in hyperactive delirium; and 3) pain, sleep disorder, and haloperidol use in hypoactive delirium.",2021,2022-08-24T07:32:31Z,2022-08-24T07:32:31Z,NA,1-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Machine learning; Support vector machines; Machine Learning; Artificial neural networks; Predictive models; Radio frequency; Data models; Sensitivity; Delirium; Predictive Model; Psychomotor Behaviors of Delirium; Rule Learning,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Older  adult participants completed a household-level sleep environment questionnaire, a  sleep questionnaire, and underwent 7-day wrist actigraphy for objective measures  of sleep. Perceived household environment (self-reported) was evaluated using  questions regarding safety, physical comfort, temperature, noise, and light  disturbances. In-bed behaviors included watching television, listening to  radio/music, use of computer/tablet/phone, playing video games, reading books,  and eating. To estimate the combined effect of the components in each domain  (perceived household environment and in-bed behaviors), we calculated and  standardized a weighted score per sleep outcome (e.g. duration, efficiency,  WASO), with a higher score indicating worse conditions. The weights were derived  from the coefficients of each component estimated from linear regression models  predicting each sleep outcome while adjusting for covariates. RESULTS: A standard  deviation increase in an adverse household environment score was associated with  lower self-reported sleep duration (β = -13.9 min, 95% confidence interval:  -26.1, -1.7) and actigraphy-based sleep efficiency (β = -0.7%, -1.4, 0.0).

Here we review two decades of research examining  parent-infant sleep practices and the variability of maternal and infant sleep  physiology and behavior in social and solitary sleeping environments. The results  challenge clinical wisdom regarding ""normal"" infant sleep, and over the past two  decades the perspective of evolutionary pediatrics has challenged the supremacy  of pediatric sleep medicine in defining what are appropriate sleep environments  and behaviors for healthy human infants. In this review, we employ a biocultural  approach that integrates diverse lines of evidence in order to illustrate the  limitations of pediatric sleep medicine in adopting a view of infants that  prioritizes recent western social values over the human infant's biological  heritage. We review what is known regarding infant sleeping arrangements among  nonhuman primates and briefly explore the possible paleoecological context within  which early human sleep patterns and parent-infant sleeping arrangements might  have evolved. The first challenges made by anthropologists to the pediatric and  SIDS research communities are traced, and two decades of studies into the  behavior and physiology of mothers and infants sleeping together are presented up  to the present. Laboratory, hospital and home studies are used to assess the  biological functions of shared mother-infant sleep, especially with regard to  breastfeeding promotion and SIDS reduction. Finally, we encourage other  anthropologists to participate in pediatric sleep research using the unique  skills and insights anthropological data provide. By employing comparative,  evolutionary and cross-cultural perspectives an anthropological approach  stimulates new research insights that influence the traditional medical paradigm  and help to make it more inclusive. That this review will potentially stimulate  similar research by other anthropologists is one obvious goal. That this article  might do so makes it ever more possible that anthropologically inspired work on  infant sleep will ultimately lead to infant sleep scientists, pediatricians, and  parents becoming more informed about the consequences of caring for human infants  in ways that are not congruent with their evolutionary biology.",2007,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,NA,133-161,NA,NA,Suppl 45,NA,Am J Phys Anthropol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 18046747,NA,NA,NA,"Animals; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Adult; History, 20th Century; Primates; Biological Evolution; Ecology; Global Health; Sleep/*physiology; Polysomnography; Behavior, Animal; Anthropology, Physical; *Breast Feeding; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Beds; *Infant Care/history; *Mother-Child Relations; *Sudden Infant Death; Pediatrics/history; Research/history",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Existing sleep posture monitoring and  classification systems may not be able to accommodate the covering of a blanket,  which represents a barrier to conducting pragmatic studies. The objective of this  study was to develop an unobtrusive sleep posture classification that could  accommodate the use of a blanket. The system uses an infrared depth camera for  data acquisition and a convolutional neural network to classify sleeping  postures. We recruited 66 participants (40 men and 26 women) to perform seven  major sleeping postures (supine, prone (head left and right), log (left and  right) and fetal (left and right)) under four blanket conditions (thick, medium,  thin, and no blanket). Data augmentation was conducted by affine transformation  and data fusion, generating additional blanket conditions with the original  dataset. Coarse-grained (four-posture) and fine-grained (seven-posture)  classifiers were trained using two fully connected network layers. For the coarse  classification, the log and fetal postures were merged into a side-lying class  and the prone class (head left and right) was pooled. The results show a drop of  overall F1-score by 8.2% when switching to the fine-grained classifier. In  addition, compared to no blanket, a thick blanket reduced the overall F1-scores  by 3.5% and 8.9% for the coarse- and fine-grained classifiers, respectively;  meanwhile, the lowest performance was seen in classifying the log (right) posture  under a thick blanket, with an F1-score of 72.0%.

There is a need to  explore new interventions to reduce falls rates, especially in geriatric and  general medical wards where older patients and those with cognitive impairment  are managed. DESIGN AND METHODS: A three-cluster stepped wedge pragmatic trial,  with an embedded qualitative process, of the Ambient Intelligent Geriatric  Management (AmbIGeM) system (wearable sensor device to alert staff of patients  undertaking at-risk activities), for preventing falls in older patients compared  with standard care. The trial will occur on three acute/subacute wards in two  hospitals in Adelaide and Perth, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged >65 years  admitted to study wards. A waiver (Perth) and opt-out of consent (Adelaide) was  obtained for this study. Patients requiring palliative care will be excluded.  OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is falls rate; secondary outcome measures are: (1)  proportion of participants falling; (2) rate of injurious inpatient falls/1000  participant bed-days; (3) acceptability and safety of the interventions from  patients and clinical staff perspectives; and (4) hospital costs, mortality and  use of residential care to 3 months postdischarge. DISCUSSION: This study  investigates a novel technological approach to preventing falls in hospitalised  older people. We hypothesise that the AmbIGeM intervention will reduce falls and  injury rates, with an economic benefit attributable to the intervention. If  successful, the AmbIGeM system will be a useful addition to falls prevention in  hospital wards with high proportions of older people and people with cognitive  impairment. : Trial registration NUMBER: Australian and New Zealand Clinical  Trial Registry: ACTRN 12617000981325; Pre-results.",2019-06,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,NA,157-165,NA,3,25,NA,Inj Prev,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

Fetal movement is thought to be an index of fetal well-being. However, as  there has never been a way to easily and reliably record fetal movement,  psychophysiological studies of pregnant women's sleep disturbance and fetal  well-being have not been done. AIMS: To solve these methodological issues, we  developed a new sensor with electrostatic capacity that can pick up acceleration  of fetal movement. METHODS AND RESULTS: Experiment I: We verified the reliability  of our fetal movement recording system. Thirty-two pregnant women (from 19 to 39  weeks of gestation) were asked to lie down on a bed for about 1 h and to press a  button as a subjective marker when they felt fetal movement. We simultaneously  recorded maternal polysonograms and fetal movement from the mothers' abdomens  using a Medilog recorder. The mean of prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa for  agreements, based on time between fetal movement signals recorded and subjective  maternal markers, was substantial at 0.75. Experiment II: We recorded seven  pregnant women's polysonograms and fetal movement simultaneously during all-night  sleep at home using our sensor during weeks 33 and 36 of gestation. We succeeded  in recording maternal micro-arousals evoked by fetal movement. The mean value of  the number of micro-arousals at 33 weeks was slightly larger than that at 36  weeks. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high agreement between subjective maternal  markers and fetal movement.

To address these gaps in  the literature, the aim of the present study was to (a) quantify physical  activity in adolescents using long-term daily actigraphy measurement and (b) to  examine the association between actigraphically assessed steps and sleep behavior  in a sample of healthy adolescents. To be able to capture intra- and  inter-individual differences in the daily physical activity of adolescents, we  examined within as well as between subjects effects and its association with  sleep. METHODS: Fifty adolescents between 10 and 14 years of age were included in  the present study. In total 5989 days of actigraphy measurement (average of  119 ± 40 days per participant; range = 39-195 days) were analyzed. We use  multilevel modeling to disentangle the within and between subject effects of  physical activity on sleep. In this way, we examine within an individual, the  association between steps during the day and subsequent sleep on a day-to-day  basis. On the other hand, our between subjects' analysis allows us to ascertain  whether individuals with more overall physical activity have better sleep.  RESULTS: Within a subject more steps on school and free days were associated with  later bed times on school and free days as well as later rise times on school  days only. On the other hand, comparing between subjects' effects, more steps  were associated with lower sleep efficiency on free and school days. No other  significant associations were found for the other sleep variables. CONCLUSION:  Our results obtained through objective and long-term measurement of both sleep  and number of steps suggest weak or non-significant associations between these  measures for most sleep variables.

It also  concerns paraplegics, tetraplegics or persons with burned injuries. Pressure  ulcers result in significant morbidity and mortality. Consequences are a high  human suffering, with high cost in terms of treatment. Several risk factors have  been identified for the development of pressure ulcers: they are classified into  extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Extrinsic factors include interface pressure,  shear forces, friction. Intrinsic factors are the nutritional state of the  patient, its age, diseases. There is little information about the mechanism of  the formation of pressure sores but it is agreed that it is a complex process.  The difficulty of the prevention lies in the evaluation of these factors. It is  an essential stage to optimize the preventative measures. Actually, no  quantifiable parameters exist to predict the formation of a pressure ulcer. This  article is aimed to propose new techniques developed for the early detection of  pressure ulcers. First, extrinsic parameters as the interface pressure and its  consequences on the mobility are investigated. A new actimeter is presented to  monitor the movements of the patient. The second part is dedicated to the  presentation of a new imaging technique which can help the physician to control  tissue elasticity of the patient. The technique is called elastography, it is a  3D strain estimation of soft biological tissues. Finally, the last way of  investigation is the combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors evaluation  for a most relevant earlier diagnosis. Before the description of these  techniques, it is essential to understand the phenomenology associated to the  development of pressure sores.

Our  primary goal was to simplify the analog and digital processing usually required  in these kinds of systems while retaining high performance. A novel sensing  approach is proposed consisting of a white LED facing a digital light detector.  This detector provides precise measurements of the variations of the light  intensity of the incident light due to the vibrations of the bed produced by the  subject's breathing, heartbeat, or activity. Four small springs, acting as a  bandpass filter, connect the boards where the LED and the detector are mounted.  Owing to the mechanical bandpass filtering caused by the compressed springs, the  proposed system generates a BCG signal that reflects the main frequencies of the  heartbeat, breathing, and movement of the lying subject. Without requiring any  analog signal processing, this device continuously transmits the measurements to  a microcontroller through a two-wire communication protocol, where they are  processed to provide an estimation of the parameters of interest in configurable  time intervals. The final information of interest is wirelessly sent to the  user's smartphone by means of a Bluetooth connection. For evaluation purposes,  the proposed system has been compared with typical BCG systems showing excellent  performance for different subject positions.

METHODS: Twenty PD patients identified with RBD were  investigated with video-supported polysomnography (PSG). Seventy-three motor  behavior events during REM sleep were graded visually and polysomnographically on  an event-to-event basis according to categorical location of movements: ""0"" = no  visible movement; ""1"" = slight movements or jerks ""2"" = movements involving  proximal extremities, including violent behavior; ""3"" = axial involvement  including bed falls. Vocalizations were rated as ""1"" for present or ""0"" for  absent. Ratings were performed by 2 blinded raters. Reliability was calculated  with Cohen's κ. Final RBD severity was determined by the highest score given.  This rating scale was then used to compare RBD severity and density, calculated  as RBD episodes per REM sleep minute over 2 consecutive nights in 10 additional  PD patients with RBD. Statistical significance was determined by effect size  (Hedges' g) and calculation of the confidence interval. RESULTS: Interrater  reliability of the scale was 0.8 for movement data and 0.89 for vocalization  data. Intraindividual RBD density varied significantly (effect size 0.5 ± 0.22;  confidence interval 0.2 to 0.79) by factor 2.5 between the 2 PSG nights. Final  RBD severity score differed in 60% of patients between nights 1 and 2. Forty  percent of patients showed violent behavior, but only on one night. All patients  had severely disturbed sleep with reduced sleep efficiency, loss of slow wave  sleep, sleep fragmentation, and an increased periodic limb movement (PLM) index.  CONCLUSION: The RBD severity scale (RBDSS) is a reliable, easy-to-use tool for  assessing motor events during REM sleep with PSG.

METHODS: Adult volunteers (n=102, 55% male and 45% female, aged  40.6 ± 13.7 years with a mean body mass index of 26.8 ± 5.8 kg/m(2)) each  participated in a one-night unattended in-lab study conducted by Fullpower  Technologies. Each participant slept on a queen-sized bed with Sleeptracker-AI  Monitor sensors placed underneath the mattress. Standard polysomnography (PSG)  was simultaneously recorded on the same night. Researchers (FD and CK) were  provided de-identified sleep studies and datasets by Fullpower Technologies for  analysis. Sleep continuity measures, 30-s epoch-by-epoch sleep stages, and apnea  and hypopnea events estimated by an automated algorithm from the Sleeptracker-AI  Monitor were compared with the PSG recordings, with the PSG recordings serving as  the reference. RESULTS: Overall, the Sleeptracker-AI Monitor estimated similar  sleep continuity measures compared with PSG. The Sleeptracker-AI Monitor  overestimated total sleep time (TST) by an average of 6.3 min and underestimated  wake after sleep onset (WASO) by 10.2 min. Sleep efficiency (SE) was similar  between the Sleeptracker-AI Monitor and PSG (87.6% and 86.3%, respectively). The  epoch-by-epoch accuracy of Sleeptracker-AI Monitor to distinguish 4-stage sleep  (wake, light, deep, and REM sleep) was 79.0% (95% CI: 77.8%, 80.2%) with a  Cohen's kappa of 0.676 (95% CI: 0.656, 0.697). Thirty-five participants (34.3%)  were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with an apnea-hypopnea index  (AHI) ≥ 5 based on PSG. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the  Sleeptracker-AI Monitor to estimate OSA (an AHI ≥5) were 87.3% (95% CI: 80.8%,  93.7%), 85.7% (95% CI: 74.1%, 97.3%), and 88.1% (95% CI: 80.3%, 95.8%)  respectively. The positive likelihood ratio (LR+) for AHI ≥5 was 7.18 (95% CI:  3.69, 14.0), and the negative likelihood ratio (LR-) for AHI ≥5 was 0.16 (95% CI:  0.072, 0.368). CONCLUSION: The Sleeptracker-AI Monitor had high accuracy,  sensitivity, and specificity in estimating sleep continuity measures and sleep  architecture, as well as in estimating apnea and hypopnea events. These findings  indicate that Sleeptracker-AI Monitor is a valid device to monitor sleep quantity  and quality among adults.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the duration as well as motor and  autonomic patterns associated with arousals across sleep stages in normal  subjects. METHODS: The spontaneous arousals of 25 healthy young adults were  randomly analyzed on polysomnography with body- and face-oriented video cameras.  The duration of the heart rate response as well as the frequency, amplitude,  speed, body segment and semiology of associated movements were measured. RESULTS:  Among 624 arousals (258 in N2, 140 in N3 and 226 in REM sleep), REM sleep  arousals had the shortest duration, and N3 arousals were associated with greater  heart rate acceleration. Movements and behaviors (mostly involving the head and  neck, then the upper limbs, with rare eyes opening and no turning in bed) were  frequent during arousals (69.4% during N2 sleep, 89.3% during N3 and 93.8% during  REM sleep). Arousals more frequently included ample, prolonged and whole-body  movements during N3 sleep and fast movements and facial expressions during REM  sleep. During N2 arousals, chewing was the most prevalent behavior. Some  movements resembled orientation and comfort behaviors (flexing/rotating the neck  and trunk, scratching, pulling the sheets, rubbing the nose, yawning, smiling,  frowning and speaking), whereas others resembled sleep-associated automatisms  (swallowing, chewing). CONCLUSION: In contrast with previous assumptions, most  arousals are associated with movements.

Time in bed or  asleep and stress at bedtime were examined as potential mechanisms. In total 117  employed participants who were aged 60-72 years and planned to retire soon were  recruited to the Swedish Retirement Study. Sleep quality was measured in a  baseline week using accelerometers, diaries, and questionnaires. Subjective sleep  measures were sleep quality, restless sleep, restorative sleep, getting enough  sleep, estimated wake after sleep onset, difficulties falling asleep, too early  final awakening, and difficulties waking up. Actigraphy measures were sleep  efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and average awakening length. After 1 and  2 years, the measurements were repeated for the now retired participants. Daily  variations in sleep quality before and after retirement were analysed using  multilevel modelling, with time in bed or asleep and stress at bedtime as  potential mediators. We found that several self-reports of sleep improved (e.g.,  +0.2 standard deviations for sleep quality and +0.5 standard deviations for  restorative sleep) while objective sleep quality remained unchanged or decreased  slightly with retirement (e.g., -0.8% for sleep efficiency). Increased time in  bed or asleep and stress at bedtime accounted partially for the improvements in  self-rated sleep quality at retirement. In conclusion, actigraph-measured and  self-reported sleep quality do not change in concert at retirement, highlighting  the interest of studying both outcomes.

We developed a multi-scale  method based on motion signal extracted from an unobtrusive device to evaluate  sleep behavior.

METHODS: The  frequency of body movements and the perioperative breathing abnormalities were  assessed using the SCSB and pulse oximeter in 15 female ASA-class I-II patients  undergoing elective lower abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Anesthesia  and control of postoperative pain followed standard practice. The patients were  monitored during one preoperative and three consecutive postoperative nights.  Movements were analyzed according to their duration and time interval. The effect  of opioids was evaluated by measuring arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2)  with pulse oximetry for one hour before and two hours after administration of  standard doses of oxycodone. RESULTS: The total movement time per hour increased  during the first postoperative night (p = 0.003).

Using ecological  momentary assessment, this intense longitudinal study explored patterns of  adolescents' daily bedtime and risetime planning and execution, and whether these  behaviours predicted sleep opportunity. METHODS: Every afternoon, for 2 school  weeks and the subsequent 2 vacation weeks, 205 (54.1% female, 64.4% non-White)  adolescents from year 10 to 12 (M ± SD(age)  = 16.9 ± 0.9) reported their plans  for bedtime (BT) that evening, and for risetimes (RT) the following day. Actual  daily sleep was measured via actigraphy and sleep diary. RESULTS: Some  adolescents never planned bedtime (school 19.5%, non-school 53.2%) or risetime  (school 1.5%, non-school 24.4%). More adolescents planned consistently (≥75% of  days) on school (BT = 29.9%, RT = 61.3%) compared to non-school nights  (BT = 3.5%, RT = 2.5%). On average, adolescents went to bed later than planned,  with longer delays on non-school (71 min) compared to school nights (46 min). Of  those who executed their plans within ≤15 min, more did it consistently (≥75% of  days) on school (BT = 40.9%, RT = 67.7%) than on non-school nights/days  (BT = 29.7%, RT = 58.6%). Mixed effects models utilizing daily data, controlling  for sex, race, and study day, showed that bedtime planning predicted longer time  in bed (TIB; p < .01) on school and shorter TIB on non-school nights (p < .01);  and greater delay in actual (compared to planned) BT predicted shorter TIB  (p < .001).

Yet, sleep restriction therapy is an essential component of most  behavioral treatments for insomnia. Moreover, little is known about the impact of  CSR on sleep continuity and structure in healthy people whose need for sleep is  satiated. We investigated the impact of CSR on sleep continuity and structure in  nine healthy participants. They had 4 nights of sleep extension, 2 nights of  post-extension sleep, 21 nights of CSR (5/5.6-hour time-in-bed), and 9 nights of  recovery sleep. Compared to postextension sleep, during CSR sleep duration was  reduced by 95.4 ± 21.2 min per night, Slow-Wave Activity was significantly  increased, and sleep was more consolidated. During recovery, sleep duration was  increased by 103.3 ± 23.8 min compared to CSR, and the CSR-induced increase in  Slow-Wave Activity persisted, particularly after the 5-hour exposure. Yet, we  found that sustained vigilant attention was not fully recovered even after nine  nights of recovery sleep. Our results suggest that CSR improves traditional  metrics of sleep quality and may have a persistent impact on sleep depth, which  is consistent with the reported benefits on sleep continuity and structure of  sleep restriction therapy. However, these improvements in traditional metrics of  sleep quality were associated with deterioration rather than improvement in  neurobehavioral performance, demonstrating that sleep duration should be included  in assessments of sleep quality. These results have implications for the  long-term use of sleep restriction in the behavioral treatment of insomnia.

METHODS: In the Need  for Sleep studies, 194 adolescents (age = 15-19 years) underwent two baseline  nights of 9-h time-in-bed (TIB), followed by two cycles of weekday manipulation  nights and weekend recovery nights (9-h TIB). They were allocated 9 h, 8 h, 6.5  h, or 5 h of TIB for nocturnal sleep on weekdays. Three additional groups with 5  h or 6.5 h TIB were given an afternoon nap opportunity (5 h + 1 h, 5 h + 1.5 h,  and 6.5 h + 1.5 h). ToT effects were quantified by performance change from the  first 2 min to the last 2 min in a 10-min Psychomotor Vigilance Task administered  daily. RESULTS: The 9 h and the 8 h groups showed comparable ToT effects that  remained at baseline levels throughout the protocol. ToT-related deficits were  greater among the 5 h and the 6.5 h groups, increased prominently in the second  week of sleep restriction despite partial recuperation during the intervening  recovery period and diverged between these two groups from the fifth  sleep-restricted night. Daytime napping attenuated ToT effects when nocturnal  sleep restriction was severe (i.e. 5-h TIB/night), and held steady at baseline  levels for a milder dose of nocturnal sleep restriction when total TIB across 24  h was within the age-specific recommended sleep duration (i.e. 6.5 h + 1.5 h).  CONCLUSIONS: Reducing TIB beyond the recommended duration significantly increases  ToT-associated vigilance impairment, particularly during recurrent periods of  sleep restriction. Daytime napping is effective in ameliorating such decrement.

METHODS: We studied 313  infants in the Rise & SHINE (Sleep Health in Infancy & Early Childhood study)  cohort. Our main exposures were the parent-reported sleep environment, feeding  method and sleep parenting strategies at infant age one month. The main outcomes  were nighttime sleep duration, longest nighttime sleep and number of awakenings  measured by actigraphy at age six months. We used multivariable linear regression  models to examine associations, and secondarily also explored the role of  sleep-related environmental exposures in mediating previously observed  associations of racial/ethnicity and parental education with infant sleep  characteristics. RESULTS: In adjusted models, a non-dark sleep environment  (versus an always dark sleep location) and taking the baby to parent's bed when  awake at night (versus no co-sleeping) were associated with 28 (95% CI, -45, -11)  and 18 (95% CI, -33, -4) minutes less sleep at night, respectively.

Reasons for variable soothing behaviors are unclear and may be influenced by  early-life sleep parenting practices. The study applied a novel method using  sleep actigraphy in mother-father-infant triads to quantify infant-only wake  bouts (i.e., ""self-soothing"") and examined associations between sleep parenting  practices from 6 to 24 weeks of age. PATIENTS/METHODS: Mother-father-infant  triads (N = 20) wore sleep monitors for 1 week at infant ages 6, 15, and 24  weeks. Data were time-matched within families to quantify infant-only wake bouts  (when infants woke in the night and parents remained asleep) to be indicative of  infant self-soothing. Mothers reported on sleep parenting practices (e.g.,  feeding to sleep, putting infants to bed while awake) using the Brief Infant  Sleep Questionnaire at each age. Mixed models tested associations between  parenting practices and infant-only wake bouts. RESULTS: Most mothers (69.5%)  reported typically feeding their infants to sleep at bedtime; 27.1% reported  typically putting infants to bed while still awake. Parenting practices  associated with a greater proportion and frequency of infant-only wake bouts  included not typically feeding infants to sleep during night wakings, putting  infants to bed while still awake (at 24 weeks of age), and using a greater  proportion of low-, rather than high-, stimulus soothing strategies during night  wakings.

Here, we assessed whether intraocular lens replacement (IOL) in  older patients with previous cataract was associated with increased stability and  amplitude of circadian rest-activity rhythms, and improved sleep quality.  METHODS: Our cross-sectional study included sixteen healthy older individuals  without ocular diseases (controls; 55-80 years; 63.6 ± 5.6y; 8 women) and 13  patients with previous cataract and bilateral IOL (eight with blue-blocking [BB]  lens and five with ultraviolet-only [UV] blocking lens; 55-80 years; 69.9 ± 5.2y;  9 women).

In humans, co-sleeping can have a major impact on  bed partners' sleep, raising the possibility that pair-housing also may influence  sleep parameters in monkeys. In the present study, we investigated if  pair-housing would impact home-cage partner's sleep in female rhesus monkeys, and  if nighttime separation using socialization panels would alter this pattern.  Sleep parameters of 10 experimentally naïve adult female rhesus monkeys (5 pairs)  were evaluated for 7 consecutive days using actigraphy monitors attached to  primate collars. Paired animals then were separated by socialization panels  during the night, and sleep-associated measures were evaluated for 7 consecutive  days. The data showed that sleep efficiency was significantly lower when monkeys  were pairhoused as compared with when they were separated. On the nights when  subjects were pair-housed, a positive correlation was detected for sleep measures  (both sleep latency and efficiency) of both members of a pair (R2's = 0.16-0.5),  suggesting that pair-housing influences sleep quality. On nights when subjects  were separated, no correlations were observed for sleep measures between members  of the pairs (R2's = 0.004-0.01), suggesting that when separated, the home-cage  partner's sleep no longer influenced the partner's sleep. Our results indicate  that pair-housing has a strong impact on the home-cage partner's sleep, and that  this pattern can be prevented by nighttime separation using socialization panels.  Studies evaluating sleep in pair-housed monkeys should consider the effects that  the partner's sleep may have on the subject's sleep.

We aimed to investigate these  claims by comparing emerging adults' sleep outcomes associated with smartphone  use before bed with iPhone's Night Shift enabled to two comparison conditions  (iPhone use with no Night Shift, no iPhone use). DESIGN: Participants were  randomly assigned to one of three conditions specifying iPhone use during the  hour preceding bedtime for seven consecutive nights: iPhone use with Night Shift  enabled; iPhone use with Night Shift disabled; and no phone use. SETTING:  Participants were recruited from a western undergraduate university.  PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 167 emerging adults (ages 18-24; 71.3% female) with  iPhones participated in the study.

Restriction of time in bed (TIB) is assumed to be the  central mechanism through which SRT improves sleep consolidation and reduces  insomnia symptoms. This hypothesis has never been directly tested. We designed a  randomized, controlled, dismantling trial in order to isolate the role of TIB  restriction in driving both clinical and polysomnographic sleep outcomes.  METHODS: Participants aged 25-55 who met diagnostic criteria for insomnia  disorder were block-randomized (1:1) to 4 weeks of SRT or time in bed  regularization (TBR), a treatment that involves the prescription of a regular but  not reduced TIB. The primary outcome was assessed with the insomnia severity  index (ISI) at baseline, 4-, and 12-weeks post-randomization. Secondary outcomes  included sleep continuity (assessed via polysomnography, actigraphy, and diary)  and quality of life. We performed intention-to-treat analyses using linear mixed  models. RESULTS: Fifty-six participants (39 females, mean age = 40.78 ± 9.08)  were assigned to SRT (n = 27) or TBR (n = 29). Daily monitoring of sleep via  diaries and actigraphy confirmed large group differences in TIB (d range =  1.63-1.98). At 4-weeks post-randomization, the adjusted mean difference for the  ISI was -4.49 (d = -1.40) and -4.35 at 12 weeks (d = -1.36), indicating that the  SRT group reported reduced insomnia severity relative to TBR. Robust treatment  effects in favor of SRT were also found for objective and self-reported sleep  continuity variables (d range = 0.40-0.92) and sleep-related quality of life (d =  1.29). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we demonstrate that TIB restriction is  superior to the regularization of TIB on its own.

We assessed changes in discrepancies between  subjective and objective sleep measures and correlations between discrepancy  changes and clinical insomnia severity for CBT-I in patients with primary  insomnia METHODS: Fifty-two outpatients (mean age, 60.3 years; 26 women) with  primary insomnia were treated by individual CBT-I (50 min, maximum six sessions,  once every 1-2 weeks). One week before and after CBT-I, patients recorded a sleep  log and wore an actigraphy device. Subjective and objective time in bed (TIB),  total sleep time (TST), sleep-onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset  (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE) were evaluated by averaging 1-week records.  Relative values of sleep discrepancy in TIB, TST, SOL, WASO, and SE were  calculated for estimating effects of CBT-I. The therapeutic effects were also  evaluated using psychological scales before and after CBT-I. RESULTS: Subjective  and objective discrepancies in sleep measures decreased by 36, 25, and 37 min in  TST, SOL, and WASO, respectively, and 7% in SE (all P < 0.001) after CBT-I. Seven  patients transitioned from underestimating SE before CBT-I to overestimating SE  after CBT-I. Although CBT-I improved relative values of discrepancy in WASO and  SE, alongside ISI, the improvement in insomnia severity only correlated with SOL  discrepancy. CONCLUSIONS: CBT-I may reduce the discrepancy between subjective and  objective sleep measures in patients with primary insomnia.

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, interventional  cohort study. SETTING: Two tertiary pediatric critical care referral units.  PATIENTS: Ten children admitted with severe traumatic brain injury defined as  Glasgow Coma Score ≤ 8 necessitating intracranial pressure monitoring (10 yrs ± 5  SD; range 2-16 yrs). INTERVENTIONS: Head elevation was randomly increased or  decreased between 0 and 40 degrees from baseline level (30 degrees) in increments  or decrements of 10 degrees. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intracranial pressure  and arterial blood pressure were continuously recorded in combination with  time-stamped clinical notations. Data were available for analysis in eight  subjects (seven males and one female; mean age, 10 yrs ± SD 5; range, 2-16 yrs)  during 18 protocol sessions. This resulted in a total of 66 head-of-the-bed  challenges. To compare results for a given change in head-of-the-bed elevation  across age, we transformed head-of-the-bed angle to change in height (cm) at the  level of Monro's foramen. An increase in head elevation of 10 cm resulted in an  average change in intracranial pressure of -3.9 mm Hg (SD ± 3.2 mm Hg; p < .001),  whereas cerebral perfusion pressure remained unchanged (0.1 ± 5.6 mm Hg; p =  .957). Individual subjects showed marked variability in intracranial pressure  change (range, -8.4 to +1.9 mm Hg/10 cm). The overall regression analysis for  intracranial pressure response was change in intracranial pressure = -0.39/cm Δh,  r2 = 0.42, and p < .001, where Δh is the change in vertical height at the level  of foramen of Monro attributable to a change in the head of the bed. CONCLUSIONS:  In severe pediatric traumatic brain injury, the relationship between change in  head of the bed and change in intracranial pressure was negative and linear. The  lowest intracranial pressure was usually, but not always, achieved at highest  head-of-the-bed angles. The effect size of a head-of-the-bed angle change  depended, in part, on the subject's height.

DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial of CBTI in  group therapy (GT), guided internet therapy (IT), and a waiting list (WL), with  assessments at baseline, directly after treatment (post-test), and at 2 months  follow-up. SETTING: Diagnostic interviews were held at the laboratory of the  Research Institute of Child Development and Education at the University of  Amsterdam. Treatment for GT occurred at the mental health care center UvAMinds in  Amsterdam, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixteen adolescents (mean  age = 15.6 y, SD = 1.6 y, 25% males) meeting DSM-IV criteria for insomnia, were  randomized to IT, GT, or WL. INTERVENTIONS: CBTI of 6 weekly sessions, consisted  of psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, restriction of time in bed, stimulus control,  cognitive therapy, and relaxation techniques. GT was conducted in groups of 6 to  8 adolescents, guided by 2 trained sleep therapists. IT was applied through an  online guided self-help website with programmed instructions and written feedback  from a trained sleep therapist. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep was measured with  actigraphy and sleep logs for 7 consecutive days. Symptoms of insomnia and  chronic sleep reduction were measured with questionnaires. Results showed that  adolescents in both IT and GT, compared to WL, improved significantly on sleep  efficiency, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time at  post-test, and improvements were maintained at follow-up. Most of these  improvements were found in both objective and subjective measures. Furthermore,  insomnia complaints and symptoms of chronic sleep reduction also decreased  significantly in both treatment conditions compared to WL. Effect sizes for  improvements ranged from medium to large. A greater proportion of participants  from the treatment conditions showed high end-state functioning and clinically  significant improvement after treatment and at follow-up compared to WL.  CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first randomized controlled trial that provides  evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is effective for the  treatment of adolescents with insomnia, with medium to large effect sizes.

The vast majority of work  establishing these effects are tightly controlled in-lab experimental studies.  Examining commonly-experienced levels of SR in naturalistic settings is more  difficult and generally involves observational methods, rather than active  manipulations of sleep. The same is true for analyzing behavioral and cognitive  outcomes at circadian unfavorable times. The current study tested the ability of  an at-home protocol to manipulate sleep schedules (i.e., impose SR), as well as  create a mismatch between a subject's circadian preference and time of testing.  Viability of the protocol was assessed via completion, compliance with the SR,  and success at manipulating sleepiness and mood. An online survey was completed  by 3630 individuals to assess initial eligibility, 256 agreed via email response  to participate in the 3-week study, 221 showed for the initial in-person session,  and 184 completed the protocol (175 with complete data). The protocol consisted  of 1 week at-home SR (5-6 hours in bed/night), 1 week wash-out, and 1 week  well-rested (WR: 8-9 hours in bed/night). Sleep was monitored with actigraphy,  diary, and call-ins. Risk management strategies were implemented for subject  safety. At the end of each experimental week, subjects reported sleepiness and  mood ratings. Protocol completion was 83%, with lower depression scores, higher  anxiety scores, and morning session assignment predicting completion. Compliance  with the sleep schedule was also very good. Subjects spent approximately 2 hours  less time in bed/night and obtained an average of 1.5 hours less nightly sleep  during SR, relative to WR, with 82% of subjects obtaining at least 60 minutes  less average nightly sleep.

With the increased demand  for unobtrusive yet quantifiable respiratory monitoring, many technologies have  been proposed recently. However, there are challenges to be addressed for such  technologies to enable widespread use. In this work, we explore the feasibility  of using load cell sensors embedded on a hospital bed for monitoring respiratory  rate (RR) and tidal volume (TV). We propose a globalized machine learning  (ML)-based algorithm for estimating TV without the requirement of  subject-specific calibration or training. In a study of 15 healthy subjects  performing respiratory tasks in four different postures, the outputs from four  load cell channels and the reference spirometer were recorded simultaneously. A  signal processing pipeline was implemented to extract features that capture  respiratory movement and the respiratory effects on the cardiac (i.e.,  ballistocardiogram, BCG) signals. The proposed RR estimation algorithm achieved a  root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.6 breaths per minute (brpm) against the ground  truth RR from the spirometer. The TV estimation results demonstrated that  combining all three axes of the low-frequency force signals and the BCG heartbeat  features best quantifies the respiratory effects of TV. The model resulted in a  correlation and RMSE between the estimated and true TV values of 0.85 and 0.23 L,  respectively, in the posture independent model without electrocardiogram (ECG)  signals. This study suggests that load cell sensors already existing in certain  hospital beds can be used for convenient and continuous respiratory monitoring in  general care settings.",2022-07,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,NA,3330-3341,NA,7,26,NA,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 34995200,NA,NA,NA,"Algorithms; Humans; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Tidal Volume; Hospitals; *Respiratory Rate; *BCG Vaccine",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The current study examined  changes in sleep variability in the course of brief behavioral therapy for  insomnia (BBT-I) in older adults who had chronic insomnia. Additionally, the  current study examined the mediating mechanisms underlying reductions of sleep  variability and the moderating effects of baseline sleep variability on treatment  responsiveness. METHODS: Sixty-two elderly participants were randomly assigned to  either BBT-I or self-monitoring and attention control (SMAC). Sleep was assessed  by sleep diaries and actigraphy from baseline to posttreatment and at 3-month  follow-up. Mixed models were used to examine changes in sleep variability  (within-person standard deviations of weekly sleep parameters) and the  hypothesized mediation and moderation effects. RESULTS: Variabilities in sleep  diary-assessed sleep onset latency (SOL) and actigraphy-assessed total sleep time  (TST) significantly decreased in BBT-I compared to SMAC (Pseudo R(2) = .12, .27;  P = .018, .008). These effects were mediated by reductions in bedtime and wake  time variability and time in bed. Significant time × group × baseline sleep  variability interactions on sleep outcomes indicated that participants who had  higher baseline sleep variability were more responsive to BBT-I; their  actigraphy-assessed TST, SOL, and sleep efficiency improved to a greater degree  (Pseudo R(2) = .15 to .66; P < .001 to .044). CONCLUSIONS: BBT-I is effective in  reducing sleep variability in older adults who have chronic insomnia.

METHODS: We investigated concordance of  self-reported habitual sleep duration compared with actigraphy- and single-night  in-home polysomnography (PSG) across white, black, Hispanic, and Chinese  participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Among 1910  adults, self-reported sleep duration, determined by differences between bed and  wake times, was overestimated in all racial groups compared with PSG and  actigraphy. Compared with whites (ρ = 0.45), correlations were significantly  lower only in blacks (ρ = 0.28). Self-reporting bias for total sleep time  compared with wrist actigraphy was 66 min (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61-71)  for whites, 58 min (95% CI: 48-69) for blacks, 66 min (95% CI: 57-74) for  Hispanics, and 60 min (95% CI: 49-70) for Chinese adults. Compared with PSG,  self-reporting bias in whites at 73 min (95% CI: 67-79) was higher than in blacks  (54 min [95% CI: 42-65]) and Chinese (49 min [95% CI: 37-61]) but not different  from Hispanics (67 min [95% CI: 56-78]). Slight agreement/concordance was  observed between self-reported and actigraphy-based total sleep time (kw = 0.14  for whites, 0.10 for blacks, 0.17 for Hispanics, and 0.11 for Chinese) and PSG  (kw = 0.08 for whites, 0.04 for blacks, 0.05 for Hispanics, and 0.01 for Chinese)  across race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported sleep duration overestimated  objectively measured sleep across all races, and compared with PSG,  overestimation is significantly greater in whites compared with blacks. Larger  reporting bias reduces the ability to identify significant associations between  sleep duration and health among blacks compared with whites.

Early warning systems using smart bed sensors hold promise to relieve this burden  and improve patient outcomes. We propose a scalable and cost-effective optical  fiber sensor array that can be embedded into a mattress to detect movement, both  sensitively and spatially. AIM: Proof-of-concept demonstration that a multimode  optical fiber (MMF) specklegram sensor array can be used to detect and image  movement on a bed. APPROACH: Seven MMFs are attached to the upper surface of a  mattress such that they cross in a 3  ×  4 array. The specklegram output is  monitored using a single laser and single camera and movement on the fibers is  monitored by calculating a rolling zero-normalized cross-correlation. A 3  ×  4  image is formed by comparing the signal at each crossing point between two  fibers. RESULTS: The MMF sensor array can detect and image movement on a bed,  including getting on and off the bed, rolling on the bed, and breathing.

DESIGN:  Prospective, case series. SETTING: Sixteen-bed pediatric intensive care unit,  oncology unit, and endoscopy suite in a tertiary care children's hospital and  ophthalmology examination rooms in an associated eye institute. PATIENTS:  Thirty-three pediatric patients undergoing propofol anesthesia for short  procedures. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Heart rate  variability metrics studied included mean, SD, low- and high-frequency power,  detrended fluctuation analysis (represented by correlation coefficient, alpha),  and approximate entropy. Compared with the initial anesthetized state, we found  increased heart rate SD (3.17 +/- 1.31 vs. 7.05 +/- 0.26 bpm, p <.0001), heart  rate low-frequency power (3.69 +/- 0.36 vs. 4.48 +/- 0.41 bpm(2)/Hz, p <.0001),  heart rate low-/high-frequency ratio (1.47 +/- 0.26 vs. 1.26 +/- 0.24, p =.001),  and heart rate alpha (1.12 +/- 0.24 vs. 1.35 +/- 0.21, p <.0001) during painful  procedure.

A.",Relationship of endogenous circadian melatonin and temperature rhythms to self-reported preference for morning or evening activity in young and older  people.,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,NA,1081-5589 1708-8267,NA,NA,"BACKGROUND: Morningness-eveningness refers to interindividual differences in preferred timing of behavior (i.e., bed and wake times). Older people have  earlier wake times and rate themselves as more morning-like than young adults. It  has been reported that the phase of circadian rhythms is earlier in morning-types  than in evening types, and that older people have earlier phases than young  adults. These changes in phase have been considered to be the chronobiological  basis of differences in preferred bed and wake times and age-related changes  therein. Whether such differences in phase are associated with changes in the  phase relationship between endogenous circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle  has not been investigated previously. METHODS: We investigated the association  between circadian phase, the phase relationship between the sleep-wake cycle and  circadian rhythms, and morningness-eveningness, and their interaction with aging.  In this circadian rhythm study, 68 young and 40 older subjects participated.  RESULTS: Among the young subjects, the phase of the melatonin and core  temperature rhythms occurred earlier in morning than in evening types and the  interval between circadian phase and usual wake time was longer in morning types.  Thus, while evening types woke at a later clock hour than morning types, morning  types actually woke at a later circadian phase. Comparing young and older morning  types we found that older morning types had an earlier circadian phase and a  shorter phase-wake time interval. The shorter phase-waketime interval in older  ""morning types"" is opposite to the change associated with morningness in young  people, and is more similar to young evening types. CONCLUSIONS: These findings  demonstrate an association between circadian phase, the relationship between the  sleep-wake cycle and circadian phase, and morningness-eveningness in young  adults. Furthermore, they demonstrate that age-related changes in phase angle  cannot be attributed fully to an age-related shift toward morningness. These  findings have important implications for understanding individual preferences in  sleep-wake timing and age-related changes in the timing of sleep.",1999-03,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,NA,141-150,NA,3,47,NA,J Investig Med,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 10198570  PMCID: PMC8530273,NA,NA,NA,"Adolescent; Humans; Adult; Aged; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Aged, 80 and over; *Circadian Rhythm; Aging/*physiology; Polysomnography; NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology; Non-NASA Center; Sleep/physiology; Body Temperature/*physiology; Melatonin/*blood",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

RESULTS: In age and sex-adjusted models,  all shift work schedules were associated with delayed sleep timing. Night and  irregular schedules were associated with shorter sleep duration, greater napping,  and greater variability of sleep. Afternoon and rotating shifts were associated  with lower sleep regularity. In fully adjusted models, night and irregular  schedules remained associated with shorter sleep duration, later sleep midpoint,  and greater variability in sleep measures compared with day schedules.

The aim of this study was to investigate periodic leg movements  (PLM), arousal and respiratory variables in 12 untreated RLS patients and to  measure the acute effects of 0.5 mg ropinirole, a nonergoline dopamine agonist,  as compared with placebo. In the target variable PLM/h of total sleep time (PLM/h  TST), RLS patients showed an increased value of 40/h (normal 0-5/h). Further, we  found an increased number of PLM (368), PLM/h of time in bed (49/h), PLM/h of REM  sleep (11), PLM/h of non-REM sleep (46) and PLM/h awake (61). The arousal index  was also increased (32/h; normal 0-25/h), as were arousals due to PLM. In the  confirmatory part of our descriptive data analysis, ropinirole 0.5 mg  significantly improved, as compared with placebo, the index PLM/h TST by 75%. In  the descriptive part, all the other PLM variables were improved as well. Arousals  due to PLM decreased, while spontaneous arousals increased. Respiratory  variables, which had a priori been in the normal range, showed a slight but  significant improvement after the dopamine agonist. Thus, 0.5 mg ropinirole  significantly improved the target variable PLM/h TST, along with objective and  subjective sleep quality and morning noopsychic performance, as described in the  preceding paper.

Falls are a major problem for older adult health,  mainly because of the consequences they entail. Falls are indeed the second  leading cause of unintentional death in the world. The impact on privacy, the  cost, low performance, or the need to wear uncomfortable devices are the main  causes for the lack of widespread solutions for fall detection and prevention.  This work present a solution focused on bedtime that addresses all these causes.  Bed exit is one of the most critical moments, especially when the person suffers  from a cognitive impairment or has mobility problems. For this reason, this work  proposes a system that monitors the position in bed in order to identify risk  situations as soon as possible. This system is also combined with an automatic  fall detection system. Both systems work together, in real time, offering a  comprehensive solution to automatic fall detection and prevention, which is low  cost and guarantees user privacy. The proposed system was experimentally  validated with young adults. Results show that falls can be detected, in real  time, with an accuracy of 93.51%, sensitivity of 92.04% and specificity of  95.45%.

The WORK-A draws on best practices from the literature and comprises 15  additional descriptive variables. Here, we demonstrate the WORK-A with a sample  of United States Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) cadets (n = 286)  during a month-long capstone pre-commissioning training exercise. METHODS: The  sleep of ROTC cadets (n = 286) was measured by Philips Actiwatch devices during  the 31-day training exercise. The preliminary effectiveness of the WORK-A was  tested by comparing differences in sleep measures collected by Actiwatches as  calculated by Philips Actiware software against WORK-A-determined sleep measures  and self-report sleep collected from a subset of ROTC cadets (n = 140). RESULTS:  Actiware sleep summary statistics were significantly different from WORK-A  measures and self-report sleep (all P ≤ 0.001). Bedtimes and waketimes as  determined by WORK-A major sleep intervals showed the best agreement with  self-report bedtime (22:21 ± 1:30 vs. 22:13 ± 0:40, P = 0.21) and waketime  (04:30 ± 2:17 vs. 04:31 ± 0:47, P = 0.68). Though still significantly different,  the discrepancy was smaller between the WORK-A measure of time in bed (TIB) for  major sleep intervals (352 ± 29 min) and self-report nightly sleep duration  (337 ± 57 min, P = 0.006) than that between the WORK-A major TIB and Actiware TIB  (177 ± 42, P ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Default actigraphy methods are not the most  accurate methods for characterizing soldier sleep, but reliable methods for  characterizing operational sleep patterns is a necessary first step in developing  strategies to improve soldier readiness. The WORK-A addresses this knowledge gap  by providing practice parameters and a robust variety of measures with which to  profile sleep behavior in service members.",2020-05-31,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,NA,31,NA,1,7,NA,Mil Med Res,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 32580783  PMCID: PMC7315473,NA,NA,NA,Adolescent; Female; Humans; Male; Adult; *Actigraphy; Teaching; *Evaluation Studies as Topic; *Military sleep assessment; *Operational environment; *Operations Research; *Scoring methodology; *Sleep-wake patterns; Actigraphy/*methods/trends; Military Medicine/*instrumentation/methods,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The main purpose of this study was to determine whether  menstrual cycle variations in distal and proximal skin temperatures exhibit  similar patterns to those of diurnal variations, with lower internal heat  conductance when CBT is high, i.e. during the luteal phase. Furthermore, we  tested these relationships in two groups of women, with and without thermal  discomfort of cold extremities (TDCE). In total, 19 healthy eumenorrheic women  with regular menstrual cycles (28-32 days), 9 with habitual TDCE (ages 29 ± 1.5  year; BMI 20.1 ± 0.4) and 10 controls without these symptoms (CON: aged 27 ± 0.8  year; BMI 22.7 ± 0.6; p < 0.004 different to TDCE) took part in the study.  Twenty-eight days continuous ambulatory skin temperature measurements of distal  (mean of hands and feet) and proximal (mean of sternum and infraclavicular  regions) skin regions, thighs, and calves were carried out under real-life,  ambulatory conditions (i-Buttons® skin probes, sampling rate: 2.5 min). The  distal minus proximal skin temperature gradient (DPG) provided a valuable measure  for heat redistribution from the core to the shell, and, hence, for internal heat  conduction. Additionally, basal body temperature was measured sublingually  directly after waking up in bed. Mean diurnal amplitudes in skin temperatures  increased from proximal to distal skin regions and the 24-h mean values were  inversely related. TDCE compared to CON showed significantly lower hand skin  temperatures and DPG during daytime. However, menstrual cycle phase did not  modify these diurnal patterns, indicating that menstrual and diurnal cycle  variations in skin temperatures reveal additive effects. Most striking was the  finding that all measured skin temperatures, together with basal body  temperature, revealed a similar menstrual cycle variation (independent of BMI),  with highest and lowest values during the luteal and follicular phases,  respectively. These findings lead to the conclusion that in contrast to diurnal  cycle, variations in CBT variation across the menstrual cycle cannot be explained  by changes in internal heat conduction under ambulatory conditions. Although no  measurements of metabolic heat production were carried out increased metabolic  heat generation during the luteal phase seems to be the most plausible  explanation for similar body temperature increases.",2014-02,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,NA,102-113,NA,1,31,NA,Chronobiol Int,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: England PMID: 24131147,NA,NA,NA,"Female; Humans; Young Adult; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Monitoring, Ambulatory; *Circadian Rhythm; Skin/pathology; *Body Temperature; Body Temperature Regulation; Cold Temperature; Skin Temperature; Sleep/physiology; *Menstrual Cycle; Follicular Phase/physiology; Luteal Phase/physiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study  aimed to identify variables predictive of weight loss success in obese patients  with OSA undertaking an intensive weight loss programme. METHODS: We analysed  biological, psychological, and behavioural variables as potential predictors of  weight loss in obese patients with OSA after a 2-month VLED followed by one of  two 10-month weight loss maintenance diets. Actigraphy, in-lab polysomnography,  urinary catecholamines, and various psychological and behavioural variables were  measured at baseline, 2, and 12 months. Spearman's correlations analysed baseline  variables with 2-month weight loss, and 2-month variables with 2-12 month-weight  change. RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed the VLED and thirty-eight completed  the maintenance diets. Actigraphy data revealed that late bedtime  (r(s) =  - 0.45, p =  < 0.01) was correlated with 2-month weight loss. The change  in the time that participants got out of bed (rise-time) from baseline to two  months was also correlated with 2-month weight loss (r(s) = 0.36, p = 0.03).

Mobility means the system can be installed and removed as required without  construction; personalization indicates human body tracking is limited to the bed  region so that only the target is monitored. To satisfy the above-mentioned  requirements, the behavior recognition system aims to: (1) operate in a  small-size device, typically an embedded system; (2) process a series of images  with narrow fields of view (NFV) to detect bed-related behaviors. In general,  wide-range images are preferred to obtain a good recognition performance for  diverse behaviors, while NFV images are used with abrupt activities and therefore  fit single-purpose applications. This paper develops an NFV-based behavior  recognition system with low complexity to realize a bed-exit monitoring  application on embedded systems. To achieve effectiveness and low complexity, a  queueing-based behavior classification is proposed to keep memories of object  tracking information and a specific behavior can be identified from continuous  object movement. The experimental results show that the developed system can  recognize three bed behaviors, namely off bed, on bed and return, for NFV images  with accuracy rates of 95~100%.",2022-07-23,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,NA,NA,NA,15,22,NA,Sensors (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 35898000  PMCID: PMC9332029,NA,NA,NA,"Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic/methods; bed exit; *Hospitals; *Recognition, Psychology; behavior recognition; images",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It remains unclear which outcome  measures best identify real CPAP effects and carry independent information.  METHODS: One hundred-two men with moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnea were  randomized to either ""real"" or ""sham"" CPAP for one month. Outcome measures were  subjective sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]) and QOL measures includiig  SF-36/SF-12 and Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI). The bed  partner's QOL and rating of patient's response to CPAP were assessed with the  Dublin questionnaire. All data were standardized using effect sizes and expressed  as real minus sham to remove the nonspecific effects of placebo. RESULTS: Real  CPAP was superior to sham CPAP in almost all outcome measures. ESS, patient's  component from Dublin, and social interactions from SAQLI showed the largest  differences in effect sizes between real and sham (1.33, 0.98, and 0.92  respectively). ESS carried the highest predictive power of real CPAP response (P  < 0.0001, r2 = 0.21). Question number 5 from Dublin (partner assessed patient's  sleep quality) and question 6 from ESS (dozing while talking) were the best  single item predictors of real CPAP response. CONCLUSIONS: Real CPAP reduces  subjective sleepiness and improves QOL of both patients and bed partners. ESS is  the best score; question number 5 from Dublin and question number 6 from ESS are  the best single item predictors of real CPAP response.

People who have  completely lost their upper limb movement functionality may benefit from  robot-assisted dressing, which involves complex deformable garment manipulation.  Here, we report a dressing pipeline intended for these people and experimentally  validate it on a medical training manikin. The pipeline is composed of the robot  grasping a hospital gown hung on a rail, fully unfolding the gown, navigating  around a bed, and lifting up the user's arms in sequence to finally dress the  user. To automate this pipeline, we address two fundamental challenges: first,  learning manipulation policies to bring the garment from an uncertain state into  a configuration that facilitates robust dressing; second, transferring the  deformable object manipulation policies learned in simulation to real world to  leverage cost-effective data generation. We tackle the first challenge by  proposing an active pre-grasp manipulation approach that learns to isolate the  garment grasping area before grasping. The approach combines prehensile and  nonprehensile actions and thus alleviates grasping-only behavioral uncertainties.  For the second challenge, we bridge the sim-to-real gap of deformable object  policy transfer by approximating the simulator to real-world garment physics. A  contrastive neural network is introduced to compare pairs of real and simulated  garment observations, measure their physical similarity, and account for  simulator parameters inaccuracies. The proposed method enables a dual-arm robot  to put back-opening hospital gowns onto a medical manikin with a success rate of  more than 90%.",2022-04-06,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,2022-08-24T07:37:57Z,NA,eabm6010,NA,65,7,NA,Sci Robot,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 35385294,NA,NA,NA,Humans; Activities of Daily Living; Clothing; *Disabled Persons; *Robotics; Bandages; Policy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Vascular effects may depend on the type of  vessel and we, therefore, investigated both smaller arteries, i.e. resistance  arteries and small arterioles, and large conduit arteries. Vascular function was  measured by acetylcholine- and sodium-nitroprusside-mediated vasodilation, and  capillary recruitment, in the skin microcirculation; by forearm blood flow (FBF)  responses to several agonists and to N-G-monomethyl L-arginine (L-NMMA) in the  forearm vascular bed; by flow-mediated vasodilation in the brachial artery; and  by determination of soluble levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1  (sVCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and E-selectin.  Twenty-eight individuals received dobesilate and 24 placebo. No effect of calcium  dobesilate on endothelial function, blood pressure or markers of oxidation was  observed compared with placebo. The difference in acetylcholine-mediated  vasodilation in the microcirculation was -52.1%-point (95% confidence interval  -132.8 to 28.1); in sodium-nitroprusside-mediated vasodilation in the  microcirculation, 2.6%-point (-95.1 to 100.2); in capillary recruitment,  2.5%-point (-6.8 to 11.7); in acetylcholine-induced increases in FBF (n=28),  23%-point (-173 to 126); in L-NMMA-induced reduction of basal FBF, -2.8%-point  (-29.3 to 23.8); in flow-mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery,  0.3%-points (-2.7 to 3.3); in 24-h systolic blood pressure, 2.1 mmHg (-1.3 to  5.5); in soluble VCAM-1, 54 ng/ml (-8 to 115); in soluble ICAM-1, 9 ng/ml (-49 to  67); in sE-selectin, -17 ng/ml (-44 to 11); in ketocholesterol 5 nM (-17 to 26);  and in oxidised LDL -1.6 U/l (-6.7 to 3.5).

With the increased demand for  unobtrusive yet quantifi- able respiratory monitoring, many technologies have been  proposed recently. However, there are challenges to be addressed for such  technologies to enable widespread use. In this work, we explore the feasibility of  using load cell sensors embedded on a hospital bed for monitoring respi- ratory rate  (RR) and tidal volume (TV). We propose a globalized machine learning (ML)-based  algorithm for estimating TV without the requirement of subject-specific calibration  or training. In a study of 15 healthy subjects performing respiratory tasks in four  different postures, the outputs from four load cell channels and the reference  spirometer were recorded simultaneously. A signal processing pipeline was  implemented to extract features that capture respira- tory movement and the  respiratory effects on the cardiac (i.e., ballistocardiogram, BCG) signals. The  proposed RR estimation algorithm achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.6  breaths per minute (brpm) against the ground truth RR from the spirometer. The TV  estimation results demonstrated that combining all three axes of the low- frequency  force signals and the BCG heartbeat features best quantifies the respiratory effects  of TV. The model resulted in a correlation and RMSE between the estimated and true  TV values of 0.85 and 0.23 L, respectively, in the posture independent model without  electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. This study suggests that load cell sensors already  existing in certain hospital beds can be used for convenient and continuous  respiratory monitoring in general care settings.",2022-01-07,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,PP,NA,IEEE J Biomed Health Inform,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 34995200,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Disinvestment from these  practices and services is risky as they may yet prove to be beneficial if further  evidence becomes available.

Our approach utilises a 3-group, concurrent, non-inferiority, stepped  wedge, randomised design with an embedded parallel, cluster randomised design.  Eighteen hospital wards with high rates of alarm use (≥3%) will be paired within  their health service and randomly allocated to a calendar month when they will  transition to a ""Reduced"" (<3%) or ""Eliminated"" (0%) mobilisation alarm condition.  Dynamic randomisation will be used to determine which ward in each pair will be  allocated to either the reduced or eliminated condition to promote equivalence  between wards for the embedded parallel, cluster randomised component of the design.

We assessed changes in discrepancies between  subjective and objective sleep measures and correlations between discrepancy changes  and clinical insomnia severity for CBT-I in patients with primary insomnia METHODS:  Fifty-two outpatients (mean age, 60.3 years; 26 women) with primary insomnia were  treated by individual CBT-I (50 min, maximum six sessions, once every 1-2 weeks).  One week before and after CBT-I, patients recorded a sleep log and wore an  actigraphy device. Subjective and objective time in bed (TIB), total sleep time  (TST), sleep-onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep  efficiency (SE) were evaluated by averaging 1-week records. Relative values of sleep  discrepancy in TIB, TST, SOL, WASO, and SE were calculated for estimating effects of  CBT-I. The therapeutic effects were also evaluated using psychological scales before  and after CBT-I. RESULTS: Subjective and objective discrepancies in sleep measures  decreased by 36, 25, and 37 min in TST, SOL, and WASO, respectively, and 7% in SE  (all P < 0.001) after CBT-I. Seven patients transitioned from underestimating SE  before CBT-I to overestimating SE after CBT-I. Although CBT-I improved relative  values of discrepancy in WASO and SE, alongside ISI, the improvement in insomnia  severity only correlated with SOL discrepancy.

METHODS: Older adult  participants completed a household-level sleep environment questionnaire, a sleep  questionnaire, and underwent 7-day wrist actigraphy for objective measures of sleep.  Perceived household environment (self-reported) was evaluated using questions  regarding safety, physical comfort, temperature, noise, and light disturbances.  In-bed behaviors included watching television, listening to radio/music, use of  computer/tablet/phone, playing video games, reading books, and eating. To estimate  the combined effect of the components in each domain (perceived household  environment and in-bed behaviors), we calculated and standardized a weighted score  per sleep outcome (e.g. duration, efficiency, WASO), with a higher score indicating  worse conditions. The weights were derived from the coefficients of each component  estimated from linear regression models predicting each sleep outcome while  adjusting for covariates.

Existing sleep posture monitoring and classification  systems may not be able to accommodate the covering of a blanket, which represents a  barrier to conducting pragmatic studies. The objective of this study was to develop  an unobtrusive sleep posture classification that could accommodate the use of a  blanket. The system uses an infrared depth camera for data acquisition and a  convolutional neural network to classify sleeping postures. We recruited 66  participants (40 men and 26 women) to perform seven major sleeping postures (supine,  prone (head left and right), log (left and right) and fetal (left and right)) under  four blanket conditions (thick, medium, thin, and no blanket). Data augmentation was  conducted by affine transformation and data fusion, generating additional blanket  conditions with the original dataset. Coarse-grained (four-posture) and fine-grained  (seven-posture) classifiers were trained using two fully connected network layers.  For the coarse classification, the log and fetal postures were merged into a  side-lying class and the prone class (head left and right) was pooled. The results  show a drop of overall F1-score by 8.2% when switching to the fine-grained  classifier. In addition, compared to no blanket, a thick blanket reduced the overall  F1-scores by 3.5% and 8.9% for the coarse- and fine-grained classifiers,  respectively; meanwhile, the lowest performance was seen in classifying the log  (right) posture under a thick blanket, with an F1-score of 72.0%. In conclusion, we  developed a system that can classify seven types of common sleeping postures under  blankets and achieved an F1-score of 88.9%.",2021-08-18,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,NA,NA,16,21,NA,Sensors (Basel),NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 34450994  PMCID: PMC8402261,NA,NA,NA,"convolutional neural network; Female; Humans; Male; Neural Networks, Computer; sleep disorder; Sleep; Posture; sleep monitoring; Bedding and Linens; *Deep Learning; sleep behavior; sleep posture recognition; sleep surveillance",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We studied the effect of epilepsy surgery in a  subset of patients. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, sleep  profile of 40 patients with drug-resistant TLE-HS was compared to 40 healthy matched  controls. Sleep architecture of 22 patients was studied by overnight PSG and  compared to 22 matched controls. Sleep profile was reassessed in 20 patients after a  minimum period of three months after epilepsy surgery. RESULTS: The mean PSQI was  higher among patients compared to controls(P=0.0004) while mean ESS showed no  difference. NCSDQ showed fewer patients feeling refreshed after a night's sleep  compared to controls (p=0.006).

Restriction of time in bed (TIB) is assumed to be the  central mechanism through which SRT improves sleep consolidation and reduces  insomnia symptoms. This hypothesis has never been directly tested. We designed a  randomized, controlled, dismantling trial in order to isolate the role of TIB  restriction in driving both clinical and polysomnographic sleep outcomes. METHODS:  Participants aged 25-55 who met diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were  block-randomized (1:1) to 4 weeks of SRT or time in bed regularization (TBR), a  treatment that involves the prescription of a regular but not reduced TIB. The  primary outcome was assessed with the insomnia severity index (ISI) at baseline, 4-,  and 12-weeks post-randomization. Secondary outcomes included sleep continuity  (assessed via polysomnography, actigraphy, and diary) and quality of life. We  performed intention-to-treat analyses using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Fifty-six  participants (39 females, mean age = 40.78 ± 9.08) were assigned to SRT (n = 27) or  TBR (n = 29). Daily monitoring of sleep via diaries and actigraphy confirmed large  group differences in TIB (d range = 1.63-1.98). At 4-weeks post-randomization, the  adjusted mean difference for the ISI was -4.49 (d = -1.40) and -4.35 at 12 weeks (d  = -1.36), indicating that the SRT group reported reduced insomnia severity relative  to TBR. Robust treatment effects in favor of SRT were also found for objective and  self-reported sleep continuity variables (d range = 0.40-0.92) and sleep-related  quality of life (d = 1.29). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, we demonstrate that TIB  restriction is superior to the regularization of TIB on its own. Our results  underscore the centrality of the restriction component in reducing insomnia symptoms  and consolidating sleep.",2020-11-12,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,zsaa096,NA,11,43,NA,Sleep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"© Sleep Research Society 2020.

The WORK-A draws on best practices from the literature and comprises 15 additional  descriptive variables. Here, we demonstrate the WORK-A with a sample of United  States Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) cadets (n = 286) during a  month-long capstone pre-commissioning training exercise. METHODS: The sleep of ROTC  cadets (n = 286) was measured by Philips Actiwatch devices during the 31-day  training exercise. The preliminary effectiveness of the WORK-A was tested by  comparing differences in sleep measures collected by Actiwatches as calculated by  Philips Actiware software against WORK-A-determined sleep measures and self-report  sleep collected from a subset of ROTC cadets (n = 140). RESULTS: Actiware sleep  summary statistics were significantly different from WORK-A measures and self-report  sleep (all P ≤ 0.001). Bedtimes and waketimes as determined by WORK-A major sleep  intervals showed the best agreement with self-report bedtime (22:21 ± 1:30 vs.  22:13 ± 0:40, P = 0.21) and waketime (04:30 ± 2:17 vs. 04:31 ± 0:47, P = 0.68).  Though still significantly different, the discrepancy was smaller between the WORK-A  measure of time in bed (TIB) for major sleep intervals (352 ± 29 min) and  self-report nightly sleep duration (337 ± 57 min, P = 0.006) than that between the  WORK-A major TIB and Actiware TIB (177 ± 42, P ≤ 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Default  actigraphy methods are not the most accurate methods for characterizing soldier  sleep, but reliable methods for characterizing operational sleep patterns is a  necessary first step in developing strategies to improve soldier readiness. The  WORK-A addresses this knowledge gap by providing practice parameters and a robust  variety of measures with which to profile sleep behavior in service members.",2020-05-31,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,31,NA,1,7,NA,Mil Med Res,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 32580783  PMCID: PMC7315473,NA,NA,NA,Adolescent; Female; Humans; Male; Adult; *Actigraphy; Teaching; *Evaluation Studies as Topic; *Military sleep assessment; *Operational environment; *Operations Research; *Scoring methodology; *Sleep-wake patterns; Actigraphy/*methods/trends; Military Medicine/*instrumentation/methods,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: Twenty-one  enuretic and 18 control children, aged 6 to 12 years old, slept with a wearable  sleep tracker device, a Fitbit Charge 2, for 14 consecutive days. In addition,  nocturnal urine production (voided volumes and/or weight of the diaper) were  measured. The HRV was calculated using the standard time and frequency domain  parameters. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to evaluate the differences in the  sleep and HRV parameters between both groups. RESULTS: Compared with healthy  controls, enuretic children showed a higher standard deviation (P = .0209) of  minutes spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep among the different nights. In  addition, they showed the tendencies to fewer awakenings (P = .1161), although this  was not significant.

There is a need to  explore new interventions to reduce falls rates, especially in geriatric and general  medical wards where older patients and those with cognitive impairment are managed.  DESIGN AND METHODS: A three-cluster stepped wedge pragmatic trial, with an embedded  qualitative process, of the Ambient Intelligent Geriatric Management (AmbIGeM)  system (wearable sensor device to alert staff of patients undertaking at-risk  activities), for preventing falls in older patients compared with standard care. The  trial will occur on three acute/subacute wards in two hospitals in Adelaide and  Perth, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged >65 years admitted to study wards. A  waiver (Perth) and opt-out of consent (Adelaide) was obtained for this study.  Patients requiring palliative care will be excluded. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome  is falls rate; secondary outcome measures are: (1) proportion of participants  falling; (2) rate of injurious inpatient falls/1000 participant bed-days; (3)  acceptability and safety of the interventions from patients and clinical staff  perspectives; and (4) hospital costs, mortality and use of residential care to 3  months postdischarge. DISCUSSION: This study investigates a novel technological  approach to preventing falls in hospitalised older people. We hypothesise that the  AmbIGeM intervention will reduce falls and injury rates, with an economic benefit  attributable to the intervention. If successful, the AmbIGeM system will be a useful  addition to falls prevention in hospital wards with high proportions of older people  and people with cognitive impairment. : Trial registration NUMBER: Australian and  New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry: ACTRN 12617000981325; Pre-results.",2019-06,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,157-165,NA,3,25,NA,Inj Prev,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

METHODS: Employed adults (N = 1253, mean age 46.3  years, 36.3% male) from the Sueño study were included. Measures of sleep duration,  timing, regularity, and continuity were calculated from 7 days of wrist-activity  monitoring.

Survey linear  regression adjusting for age, sex, background, site, number of jobs, and work hours  was used. RESULTS: In age and sex-adjusted models, all shift work schedules were  associated with delayed sleep timing. Night and irregular schedules were associated  with shorter sleep duration, greater napping, and greater variability of sleep.  Afternoon and rotating shifts were associated with lower sleep regularity. In fully  adjusted models, night and irregular schedules remained associated with shorter  sleep duration, later sleep midpoint, and greater variability in sleep measures  compared with day schedules.

The present study aimed to investigate whether use of the mattress  with continuous, automatic, interface pressure mapping-based regulation of inner  air-cell pressure (i.e., robotic mattress) improves comfort over that provided by  body weight-based pressure regulation (traditional approach) in healthy volunteers.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A robotic mattress was used with two settings (i.e.,  interface pressure-vs. body weight-based regulation). First, 20 healthy volunteers  were recruited, and the level of comfort, interface pressure distribution, body  immersion, and tissue oxygenation were measured and compared between the two  settings. RESULTS: The level of comfort (20.5 vs 47.5, p = 0.014), contact area  (2263.9 vs 2145.2 cm(2), p = 0.002), and body immersion for healthy participants  were significantly larger when using the interface pressure-based setting.

METHODS: We investigated concordance of  self-reported habitual sleep duration compared with actigraphy- and single-night  in-home polysomnography (PSG) across white, black, Hispanic, and Chinese  participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Among 1910  adults, self-reported sleep duration, determined by differences between bed and wake  times, was overestimated in all racial groups compared with PSG and actigraphy.  Compared with whites (ρ = 0.45), correlations were significantly lower only in  blacks (ρ = 0.28). Self-reporting bias for total sleep time compared with wrist  actigraphy was 66 min (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61-71) for whites, 58 min (95%  CI: 48-69) for blacks, 66 min (95% CI: 57-74) for Hispanics, and 60 min (95% CI:  49-70) for Chinese adults. Compared with PSG, self-reporting bias in whites at 73  min (95% CI: 67-79) was higher than in blacks (54 min [95% CI: 42-65]) and Chinese  (49 min [95% CI: 37-61]) but not different from Hispanics (67 min [95% CI: 56-78]).

The primary objective of this study is to  determine whether PAP adherence in patients who had a stroke with obstructive sleep  apnoea (OSA) can be improved by a PAP training strategy during inhospital  rehabilitation combined with a telemedicine monitoring system after discharge.  Further objectives are (1) to compare the validity of a non-attended level-III  polygraphy with that of a level-II polysomnography (PSG) in the diagnosis of SA, (2)  to compare the validity of an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) yielded by the PAP device  with that obtained during PSG, (3) to determine changes in nocturnal systolic blood  pressure (BP) due to PAP therapy with the pulse transit time (PTT) method and (4) to  assess the impact of telemonitored PAP therapy on neurorehabilitation outcome  parameters. METHODS AND ANALYSES: Single-blind, monocentre, randomised controlled  trial. It includes 55 patients who had a subacute stroke, aged 19-70 years, with  moderate to severe OSA, who have undergone successful PAP training and titration at  the neurorehabilitation unit. Patients are randomised to either a standard care  group or a telemedicine group.PAP adherence, sleep and respiratory variables,  subjective and objective sleep quality, systolic BP (PTT method) of the two groups  are compared after 3 months and 1 year as well as cognitive and motor  neurorehabilitation outcome parameters, quality of life and PAP satisfaction.  Additionally, intranight AHI/total sleep time versus AHI/time in bed and  night-to-night variability of the AHI are assessed.

The current study examined  changes in sleep variability in the course of brief behavioral therapy for insomnia  (BBT-I) in older adults who had chronic insomnia. Additionally, the current study  examined the mediating mechanisms underlying reductions of sleep variability and the  moderating effects of baseline sleep variability on treatment responsiveness.  METHODS: Sixty-two elderly participants were randomly assigned to either BBT-I or  self-monitoring and attention control (SMAC). Sleep was assessed by sleep diaries  and actigraphy from baseline to posttreatment and at 3-month follow-up. Mixed models  were used to examine changes in sleep variability (within-person standard deviations  of weekly sleep parameters) and the hypothesized mediation and moderation effects.  RESULTS: Variabilities in sleep diary-assessed sleep onset latency (SOL) and  actigraphy-assessed total sleep time (TST) significantly decreased in BBT-I compared  to SMAC (Pseudo R(2) = .12, .27; P = .018, .008). These effects were mediated by  reductions in bedtime and wake time variability and time in bed. Significant time ×  group × baseline sleep variability interactions on sleep outcomes indicated that  participants who had higher baseline sleep variability were more responsive to  BBT-I; their actigraphy-assessed TST, SOL, and sleep efficiency improved to a  greater degree (Pseudo R(2) = .15 to .66; P < .001 to .044). CONCLUSIONS: BBT-I is  effective in reducing sleep variability in older adults who have chronic insomnia.  Increased consistency in bedtime and wake time and decreased time in bed mediate  reductions of sleep variability. Baseline sleep variability may serve as a marker of  high treatment responsiveness to BBT-I.

The vast majority of work  establishing these effects are tightly controlled in-lab experimental studies.  Examining commonly-experienced levels of SR in naturalistic settings is more  difficult and generally involves observational methods, rather than active  manipulations of sleep. The same is true for analyzing behavioral and cognitive  outcomes at circadian unfavorable times. The current study tested the ability of an  at-home protocol to manipulate sleep schedules (i.e., impose SR), as well as create  a mismatch between a subject's circadian preference and time of testing. Viability  of the protocol was assessed via completion, compliance with the SR, and success at  manipulating sleepiness and mood. An online survey was completed by 3630 individuals  to assess initial eligibility, 256 agreed via email response to participate in the  3-week study, 221 showed for the initial in-person session, and 184 completed the  protocol (175 with complete data). The protocol consisted of 1 week at-home SR (5-6  hours in bed/night), 1 week wash-out, and 1 week well-rested (WR: 8-9 hours in  bed/night). Sleep was monitored with actigraphy, diary, and call-ins. Risk  management strategies were implemented for subject safety. At the end of each  experimental week, subjects reported sleepiness and mood ratings. Protocol  completion was 83%, with lower depression scores, higher anxiety scores, and morning  session assignment predicting completion. Compliance with the sleep schedule was  also very good. Subjects spent approximately 2 hours less time in bed/night and  obtained an average of 1.5 hours less nightly sleep during SR, relative to WR, with  82% of subjects obtaining at least 60 minutes less average nightly sleep. Sleepiness  and mood were impacted as expected by SR. These findings show the viability of  studying experimental chronic sleep restriction outside the laboratory, assuming  appropriate safety precautions are taken, thus allowing investigators to  significantly increase ecological validity over strictly controlled in-lab studies.",2017,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,e0174367,NA,3,12,NA,PLoS One,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 28319182  PMCID: PMC5358873,NA,NA,NA,Adolescent; Female; Humans; Male; Time Factors; Young Adult; Adult; Internet; Depression; Medical Records; Actigraphy; Sleep; Anxiety; Self Report; Housing; Affect; *Research Design; *Circadian Rhythm; Risk Management; Behavior; *Sleep Deprivation; Caffeine/administration & dosage,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial of CBTI in  group therapy (GT), guided internet therapy (IT), and a waiting list (WL), with  assessments at baseline, directly after treatment (post-test), and at 2 months  follow-up. SETTING: Diagnostic interviews were held at the laboratory of the  Research Institute of Child Development and Education at the University of  Amsterdam. Treatment for GT occurred at the mental health care center UvAMinds in  Amsterdam, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixteen adolescents (mean age  = 15.6 y, SD = 1.6 y, 25% males) meeting DSM-IV criteria for insomnia, were  randomized to IT, GT, or WL. INTERVENTIONS: CBTI of 6 weekly sessions, consisted of  psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, restriction of time in bed, stimulus control,  cognitive therapy, and relaxation techniques. GT was conducted in groups of 6 to 8  adolescents, guided by 2 trained sleep therapists. IT was applied through an online  guided self-help website with programmed instructions and written feedback from a  trained sleep therapist. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep was measured with  actigraphy and sleep logs for 7 consecutive days. Symptoms of insomnia and chronic  sleep reduction were measured with questionnaires. Results showed that adolescents  in both IT and GT, compared to WL, improved significantly on sleep efficiency, sleep  onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time at post-test, and  improvements were maintained at follow-up. Most of these improvements were found in  both objective and subjective measures. Furthermore, insomnia complaints and  symptoms of chronic sleep reduction also decreased significantly in both treatment  conditions compared to WL. Effect sizes for improvements ranged from medium to  large. A greater proportion of participants from the treatment conditions showed  high end-state functioning and clinically significant improvement after treatment  and at follow-up compared to WL.

The main purpose of this study was to determine whether menstrual cycle variations  in distal and proximal skin temperatures exhibit similar patterns to those of  diurnal variations, with lower internal heat conductance when CBT is high, i.e.  during the luteal phase. Furthermore, we tested these relationships in two groups of  women, with and without thermal discomfort of cold extremities (TDCE). In total, 19  healthy eumenorrheic women with regular menstrual cycles (28-32 days), 9 with  habitual TDCE (ages 29 ± 1.5 year; BMI 20.1 ± 0.4) and 10 controls without these  symptoms (CON: aged 27 ± 0.8 year; BMI 22.7 ± 0.6; p < 0.004 different to TDCE) took  part in the study. Twenty-eight days continuous ambulatory skin temperature  measurements of distal (mean of hands and feet) and proximal (mean of sternum and  infraclavicular regions) skin regions, thighs, and calves were carried out under  real-life, ambulatory conditions (i-Buttons® skin probes, sampling rate: 2.5 min).  The distal minus proximal skin temperature gradient (DPG) provided a valuable  measure for heat redistribution from the core to the shell, and, hence, for internal  heat conduction. Additionally, basal body temperature was measured sublingually  directly after waking up in bed. Mean diurnal amplitudes in skin temperatures  increased from proximal to distal skin regions and the 24-h mean values were  inversely related. TDCE compared to CON showed significantly lower hand skin  temperatures and DPG during daytime. However, menstrual cycle phase did not modify  these diurnal patterns, indicating that menstrual and diurnal cycle variations in  skin temperatures reveal additive effects. Most striking was the finding that all  measured skin temperatures, together with basal body temperature, revealed a similar  menstrual cycle variation (independent of BMI), with highest and lowest values  during the luteal and follicular phases, respectively. These findings lead to the  conclusion that in contrast to diurnal cycle, variations in CBT variation across the  menstrual cycle cannot be explained by changes in internal heat conduction under  ambulatory conditions. Although no measurements of metabolic heat production were  carried out increased metabolic heat generation during the luteal phase seems to be  the most plausible explanation for similar body temperature increases.",2014-02,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,102-113,NA,1,31,NA,Chronobiol Int,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: England PMID: 24131147,NA,NA,NA,"Female; Humans; Young Adult; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Monitoring, Ambulatory; *Circadian Rhythm; Skin/pathology; *Body Temperature; Body Temperature Regulation; Cold Temperature; Skin Temperature; Sleep/physiology; *Menstrual Cycle; Follicular Phase/physiology; Luteal Phase/physiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, interventional  cohort study. SETTING: Two tertiary pediatric critical care referral units.  PATIENTS: Ten children admitted with severe traumatic brain injury defined as  Glasgow Coma Score ≤ 8 necessitating intracranial pressure monitoring (10 yrs ± 5  SD; range 2-16 yrs). INTERVENTIONS: Head elevation was randomly increased or  decreased between 0 and 40 degrees from baseline level (30 degrees) in increments or  decrements of 10 degrees. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Intracranial pressure and  arterial blood pressure were continuously recorded in combination with time-stamped  clinical notations. Data were available for analysis in eight subjects (seven males  and one female; mean age, 10 yrs ± SD 5; range, 2-16 yrs) during 18 protocol  sessions. This resulted in a total of 66 head-of-the-bed challenges. To compare  results for a given change in head-of-the-bed elevation across age, we transformed  head-of-the-bed angle to change in height (cm) at the level of Monro's foramen. An  increase in head elevation of 10 cm resulted in an average change in intracranial  pressure of -3.9 mm Hg (SD ± 3.2 mm Hg; p < .001), whereas cerebral perfusion  pressure remained unchanged (0.1 ± 5.6 mm Hg; p = .957). Individual subjects showed  marked variability in intracranial pressure change (range, -8.4 to +1.9 mm Hg/10  cm). The overall regression analysis for intracranial pressure response was change  in intracranial pressure = -0.39/cm Δh, r2 = 0.42, and p < .001, where Δh is the  change in vertical height at the level of foramen of Monro attributable to a change  in the head of the bed. CONCLUSIONS: In severe pediatric traumatic brain injury, the  relationship between change in head of the bed and change in intracranial pressure  was negative and linear. The lowest intracranial pressure was usually, but not  always, achieved at highest head-of-the-bed angles. The effect size of a  head-of-the-bed angle change depended, in part, on the subject's height.

METHODS: Twenty PD patients identified with RBD were investigated with  video-supported polysomnography (PSG). Seventy-three motor behavior events during  REM sleep were graded visually and polysomnographically on an event-to-event basis  according to categorical location of movements: ""0"" = no visible movement; ""1"" =  slight movements or jerks ""2"" = movements involving proximal extremities, including  violent behavior; ""3"" = axial involvement including bed falls. Vocalizations were  rated as ""1"" for present or ""0"" for absent. Ratings were performed by 2 blinded  raters. Reliability was calculated with Cohen's κ. Final RBD severity was determined  by the highest score given. This rating scale was then used to compare RBD severity  and density, calculated as RBD episodes per REM sleep minute over 2 consecutive  nights in 10 additional PD patients with RBD. Statistical significance was  determined by effect size (Hedges' g) and calculation of the confidence interval.  RESULTS: Interrater reliability of the scale was 0.8 for movement data and 0.89 for  vocalization data. Intraindividual RBD density varied significantly (effect size 0.5  ± 0.22; confidence interval 0.2 to 0.79) by factor 2.5 between the 2 PSG nights.  Final RBD severity score differed in 60% of patients between nights 1 and 2. Forty  percent of patients showed violent behavior, but only on one night. All patients had  severely disturbed sleep with reduced sleep efficiency, loss of slow wave sleep,  sleep fragmentation, and an increased periodic limb movement (PLM) index.

It remains unclear which outcome  measures best identify real CPAP effects and carry independent information. METHODS:  One hundred-two men with moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnea were randomized to  either ""real"" or ""sham"" CPAP for one month. Outcome measures were subjective  sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]) and QOL measures includiig SF-36/SF-12  and Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI). The bed partner's QOL and  rating of patient's response to CPAP were assessed with the Dublin questionnaire.  All data were standardized using effect sizes and expressed as real minus sham to  remove the nonspecific effects of placebo. RESULTS: Real CPAP was superior to sham  CPAP in almost all outcome measures. ESS, patient's component from Dublin, and  social interactions from SAQLI showed the largest differences in effect sizes  between real and sham (1.33, 0.98, and 0.92 respectively). ESS carried the highest  predictive power of real CPAP response (P < 0.0001, r2 = 0.21). Question number 5  from Dublin (partner assessed patient's sleep quality) and question 6 from ESS  (dozing while talking) were the best single item predictors of real CPAP response.  CONCLUSIONS: Real CPAP reduces subjective sleepiness and improves QOL of both  patients and bed partners.

Fetal movement is thought to be an index of fetal well-being. However, as there has  never been a way to easily and reliably record fetal movement, psychophysiological  studies of pregnant women's sleep disturbance and fetal well-being have not been  done. AIMS: To solve these methodological issues, we developed a new sensor with  electrostatic capacity that can pick up acceleration of fetal movement. METHODS AND  RESULTS: Experiment I: We verified the reliability of our fetal movement recording  system. Thirty-two pregnant women (from 19 to 39 weeks of gestation) were asked to  lie down on a bed for about 1 h and to press a button as a subjective marker when  they felt fetal movement. We simultaneously recorded maternal polysonograms and  fetal movement from the mothers' abdomens using a Medilog recorder. The mean of  prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa for agreements, based on time between fetal  movement signals recorded and subjective maternal markers, was substantial at 0.75.  Experiment II: We recorded seven pregnant women's polysonograms and fetal movement  simultaneously during all-night sleep at home using our sensor during weeks 33 and  36 of gestation. We succeeded in recording maternal micro-arousals evoked by fetal  movement. The mean value of the number of micro-arousals at 33 weeks was slightly  larger than that at 36 weeks.

Here we review two decades of research examining  parent-infant sleep practices and the variability of maternal and infant sleep  physiology and behavior in social and solitary sleeping environments. The results  challenge clinical wisdom regarding ""normal"" infant sleep, and over the past two  decades the perspective of evolutionary pediatrics has challenged the supremacy of  pediatric sleep medicine in defining what are appropriate sleep environments and  behaviors for healthy human infants. In this review, we employ a biocultural  approach that integrates diverse lines of evidence in order to illustrate the  limitations of pediatric sleep medicine in adopting a view of infants that  prioritizes recent western social values over the human infant's biological  heritage. We review what is known regarding infant sleeping arrangements among  nonhuman primates and briefly explore the possible paleoecological context within  which early human sleep patterns and parent-infant sleeping arrangements might have  evolved. The first challenges made by anthropologists to the pediatric and SIDS  research communities are traced, and two decades of studies into the behavior and  physiology of mothers and infants sleeping together are presented up to the present.  Laboratory, hospital and home studies are used to assess the biological functions of  shared mother-infant sleep, especially with regard to breastfeeding promotion and  SIDS reduction. Finally, we encourage other anthropologists to participate in  pediatric sleep research using the unique skills and insights anthropological data  provide. By employing comparative, evolutionary and cross-cultural perspectives an  anthropological approach stimulates new research insights that influence the  traditional medical paradigm and help to make it more inclusive. That this review  will potentially stimulate similar research by other anthropologists is one obvious  goal. That this article might do so makes it ever more possible that  anthropologically inspired work on infant sleep will ultimately lead to infant sleep  scientists, pediatricians, and parents becoming more informed about the consequences  of caring for human infants in ways that are not congruent with their evolutionary  biology.",2007,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,133-161,NA,NA,Suppl 45,NA,Am J Phys Anthropol,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,"(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 18046747,NA,NA,NA,"Animals; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Adult; History, 20th Century; Primates; Biological Evolution; Ecology; Global Health; Sleep/*physiology; Polysomnography; Behavior, Animal; Anthropology, Physical; *Breast Feeding; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Beds; *Infant Care/history; *Mother-Child Relations; *Sudden Infant Death; Pediatrics/history; Research/history",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We propose a method to reliably estimate  respiratory rate using a bed-based pressure sensor array. Movements are detected  prior to respiratory rate estimation and suppressed. The amount of movement during  an estimate and a weighting for the estimate are used to create a reliability  metric. The reliability metric is scored out of 100 for each sensor where high  scores denote more reliable data. Once respiratory rates were calculated, the mean  reliability metric determined the estimate reliability. Nocturnal data from a male  and female participant was analyzed. Results show better accuracy and validity than  both analysis without movement suppression and analysis with movement suppression  but without postprocessing data fusion. While more than 50% of estimates include  movement corruption, only 15% are unreliable and, moreover, removal of unreliable  estimates significantly reduces estimate variance and provides validity estimation.",2006,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,6410-6413,NA,NA,2006,NA,Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 17946763,NA,NA,NA,"Algorithms; Software; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Reproducibility of Results; Equipment Design; Sleep; *Respiration; Pressure; Beds; Monitoring, Physiologic/*instrumentation/methods; Polysomnography/*instrumentation/methods",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It also concerns  paraplegics, tetraplegics or persons with burned injuries. Pressure ulcers result in  significant morbidity and mortality. Consequences are a high human suffering, with  high cost in terms of treatment. Several risk factors have been identified for the  development of pressure ulcers: they are classified into extrinsic and intrinsic  factors. Extrinsic factors include interface pressure, shear forces, friction.  Intrinsic factors are the nutritional state of the patient, its age, diseases. There  is little information about the mechanism of the formation of pressure sores but it  is agreed that it is a complex process. The difficulty of the prevention lies in the  evaluation of these factors. It is an essential stage to optimize the preventative  measures. Actually, no quantifiable parameters exist to predict the formation of a  pressure ulcer. This article is aimed to propose new techniques developed for the  early detection of pressure ulcers. First, extrinsic parameters as the interface  pressure and its consequences on the mobility are investigated. A new actimeter is  presented to monitor the movements of the patient. The second part is dedicated to  the presentation of a new imaging technique which can help the physician to control  tissue elasticity of the patient. The technique is called elastography, it is a 3D  strain estimation of soft biological tissues. Finally, the last way of investigation  is the combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors evaluation for a most relevant  earlier diagnosis. Before the description of these techniques, it is essential to  understand the phenomenology associated to the development of pressure sores. Only  in this way, new techniques can be developed.",2006,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,6057-6060,NA,NA,2006,NA,Conf Proc IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: United States PMID: 17946739,NA,NA,NA,"Software; Humans; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Risk Factors; Computers; Heart Rate; Monitoring, Ambulatory/*methods; Pressure; Beds; Nursing Homes; *Equipment Design; Pressure Ulcer/*diagnosis/*prevention & control; Elasticity Imaging Techniques/*instrumentation/methods; Microcirculation",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Vascular effects may depend on the type of vessel  and we, therefore, investigated both smaller arteries, i.e. resistance arteries and  small arterioles, and large conduit arteries. Vascular function was measured by  acetylcholine- and sodium-nitroprusside-mediated vasodilation, and capillary  recruitment, in the skin microcirculation; by forearm blood flow (FBF) responses to  several agonists and to N-G-monomethyl L-arginine (L-NMMA) in the forearm vascular  bed; by flow-mediated vasodilation in the brachial artery; and by determination of  soluble levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), intercellular  adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and E-selectin. Twenty-eight individuals received  dobesilate and 24 placebo. No effect of calcium dobesilate on endothelial function,  blood pressure or markers of oxidation was observed compared with placebo. The  difference in acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation in the microcirculation was  -52.1%-point (95% confidence interval -132.8 to 28.1); in  sodium-nitroprusside-mediated vasodilation in the microcirculation, 2.6%-point  (-95.1 to 100.2); in capillary recruitment, 2.5%-point (-6.8 to 11.7); in  acetylcholine-induced increases in FBF (n=28), 23%-point (-173 to 126); in  L-NMMA-induced reduction of basal FBF, -2.8%-point (-29.3 to 23.8); in flow-mediated  vasodilation of the brachial artery, 0.3%-points (-2.7 to 3.3); in 24-h systolic  blood pressure, 2.1 mmHg (-1.3 to 5.5); in soluble VCAM-1, 54 ng/ml (-8 to 115); in  soluble ICAM-1, 9 ng/ml (-49 to 67); in sE-selectin, -17 ng/ml (-44 to 11); in  ketocholesterol 5 nM (-17 to 26); and in oxidised LDL -1.6 U/l (-6.7 to 3.5).

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN  RESULTS: Heart rate variability metrics studied included mean, SD, low- and  high-frequency power, detrended fluctuation analysis (represented by correlation  coefficient, alpha), and approximate entropy.

In  the target variable PLM/h of total sleep time (PLM/h TST), RLS patients showed an  increased value of 40/h (normal 0-5/h). Further, we found an increased number of PLM  (368), PLM/h of time in bed (49/h), PLM/h of REM sleep (11), PLM/h of non-REM sleep  (46) and PLM/h awake (61).

Older people have earlier  wake times and rate themselves as more morning-like than young adults. It has been  reported that the phase of circadian rhythms is earlier in morning-types than in  evening types, and that older people have earlier phases than young adults. These  changes in phase have been considered to be the chronobiological basis of  differences in preferred bed and wake times and age-related changes therein. Whether  such differences in phase are associated with changes in the phase relationship  between endogenous circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle has not been  investigated previously. METHODS: We investigated the association between circadian  phase, the phase relationship between the sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms,  and morningness-eveningness, and their interaction with aging. In this circadian  rhythm study, 68 young and 40 older subjects participated. RESULTS: Among the young  subjects, the phase of the melatonin and core temperature rhythms occurred earlier  in morning than in evening types and the interval between circadian phase and usual  wake time was longer in morning types. Thus, while evening types woke at a later  clock hour than morning types, morning types actually woke at a later circadian  phase. Comparing young and older morning types we found that older morning types had  an earlier circadian phase and a shorter phase-wake time interval. The shorter  phase-waketime interval in older ""morning types"" is opposite to the change  associated with morningness in young people, and is more similar to young evening  types. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate an association between circadian  phase, the relationship between the sleep-wake cycle and circadian phase, and  morningness-eveningness in young adults. Furthermore, they demonstrate that  age-related changes in phase angle cannot be attributed fully to an age-related  shift toward morningness. These findings have important implications for  understanding individual preferences in sleep-wake timing and age-related changes in  the timing of sleep.",1999-03,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,141-150,NA,3,47,NA,J Investig Med,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 10198570  PMCID: PMC8530273,NA,NA,NA,"Adolescent; Humans; Adult; Aged; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires; Aged, 80 and over; *Circadian Rhythm; Aging/*physiology; Polysomnography; NASA Discipline Regulatory Physiology; Non-NASA Center; Sleep/physiology; Body Temperature/*physiology; Melatonin/*blood",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

METHODS: The frequency  of body movements and the perioperative breathing abnormalities were assessed using  the SCSB and pulse oximeter in 15 female ASA-class I-II patients undergoing elective  lower abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Anesthesia and control of  postoperative pain followed standard practice. The patients were monitored during  one preoperative and three consecutive postoperative nights. Movements were analyzed  according to their duration and time interval. The effect of opioids was evaluated  by measuring arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) with pulse oximetry for one  hour before and two hours after administration of standard doses of oxycodone.  RESULTS: The total movement time per hour increased during the first postoperative  night (p = 0.003). Conversely, periodic movement activity decreased significantly  during the three postoperative nights (p = 0.05, p < 0.001, p = 0.007). The mean  SpO2 decreased during the first postoperative night (95.5% vs. 94.2%, p = 0.002),  but returned to the preoperative level during the following nights. No episodes of  apnea with significant oxygen desaturation (a decrease in SpO2 > 5%) were observed.  Opioid administration was associated with decreased mean SpO2 (94.8% vs. 93.6%, p =  0.02), but did not lead to clinically significant hypoxemia (lowest observed SpO2  89.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative periodic movement activity was suppressed, but  sleep remained fragmented with frequent body movements.

Perioperative movement monitoring with the SCSB  was a valuable tool in rejecting movement artefacts of SpO2 and in evaluating  general sleep quality.",1998-05,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,239-244,NA,4,14,NA,J Clin Monit Comput,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Place: Netherlands PMID: 9754612,NA,NA,NA,"Female; Humans; Adult; Aged; Middle Aged; Sleep; Respiration; Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods; Oximetry; Movement/*physiology; Beds; Postoperative Care; *Anesthesia, General/adverse effects; Abdomen/surgery; Hypoxia/*diagnosis; Postoperative Complications/diagnosis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the healthy controls the  lower 95% tolerance limits for total 24 hour RR interval counts were approximately  2000 at age 25, 1000 at 45, and 500 at 65 years. Six controls confined to bed after  injury had normal 24 hour patterns of RR counts, while eight other controls showed  loss of diurnal variation in both heart rate and RR counts during a period of sleep  deprivation. RR counts in ten controls on and off night duty increased during sleep  whenever it occurred. Nearly half (146) the 343 diabetic patients had abnormal 24  hour RR counts. The percentage of abnormal RR counts increased with increasing  autonomic abnormality assessed by a standard battery of tests of cardiovascular  autonomic function. A quarter of those with normal cardiovascular reflex tests had  abnormal 24 hour RR counts. There were close correlations between 24 hour RR count  results and the individual heart rate tests (r = 0.6). The assessment of cardiac  parasympathetic activity by 24 hour RR counts was reliable. The diurnal variations  in RR counts seen in the controls were probably related to sleep rather than either  posture or time of day. The method was more sensitive than conventional tests of  cardiovascular reflexes.",1991-05,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,2022-08-24T07:36:05Z,NA,239-244,NA,5,65,NA,Br Heart J,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,eng,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PMID: 2039667  PMCID: PMC1024623,NA,NA,NA,"Electrocardiography; Adolescent; Female; Humans; Male; Adult; Aged; Middle Aged; Heart Rate/*physiology; Diabetes Mellitus/*physiopathology; Circadian Rhythm/physiology; Sleep/physiology; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; Posture/physiology; Autonomic Nervous System/*physiology; Heart/*physiopathology; Immobilization; Sleep Deprivation/physiology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, due to a shortage of long-term care workers, repositioning might not be implemented as often as required. Posture monitoring by using modern health/medical caring technology can potentially solve this problem. We propose a RGB-D camera system to recognize the posture of the bedridden elderly patients based on the analysis of 3D human skeleton which consists of articulated joints. Since practically most bedridden patients were covered with a blanket, only four 3D joints were used in our system. After the recognition of the posture, a warning message will be sent to the caregiver for assistance if the patient stays in the same posture for more than a predetermined period (e.g., two hours). Experimental results indicate that our proposed method is capable of achieving a high accuracy in posture recognition (above 95%). To the best of our knowledge, this application of using human skeleton analysis for patient care is novel. The proposed scheme is promising for clinical applications and will undertake an intensive test in health care facilities in the near future after redesigning a proper RGB-D (Red-Green-Blue-Depth) camera system. In addition, a desktop computer can be used for multi-point monitoring to reduce cost, since real-time processing is not required in this application.",2022-03,2022-08-24T07:42:44Z,2022-08-24T07:42:44Z,NA,NA,NA,6,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000776064800001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A prospective pilot study was conducted with 33 participants admitted to a long-term care facility between August 10 and 25, 2020. During the pilot study, we collected 560 cases that included 33 clinical variables and the survey items from the short confusion assessment method (S-CAM), and developed a mobile-based application. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including four rule-mining algorithms (C4.5, CBA, MCAR, and LEM2) and four other statistical learning algorithms (LR, ANNs, SVMs with three kernel functions, and random forest), were validated by paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests on both macro-averaged F1 and weighted average F1-measures during the 10-times stratified 2-fold cross-validation. The LEM2 algorithm achieved the best prediction performance (macro-averaged F1-measure of 49.35%; weighted average F1-measure of 96.55%), correctly identifying adult patients at delirium risk. In the pairwise comparison between predictive powers observed from independent models, the LEM2 model showed a medium or large effect size between 0.4925 and 0.8766 when compared with LR, ANN, SVM with RBF, and MCAR models. We have confirmed that acute consciousness in S-CAM assessment is closely associated with different predictors for screening three psychomotor behaviors of delirium: 1) education level, dementia type or its level, sleep disorder, dehydration, and infection in mixed-type delirium; 2) gender, education level, dementia type, dehydration, bedsores, and foley catheter in hyperactive delirium; and 3) pain, sleep disorder, and haloperidol use in hypoactive delirium.",2022-04,2022-08-24T07:42:46Z,2022-08-24T07:42:46Z,NA,1802-1814,NA,4,26,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000803121800042,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Moreover, with the growth in the amount of data, machine learning methods are commonly used to predict the surface subsidence. The 10 mm subsidence boundary is an important indicator to determine the influence range, and FLAC(3D) is suitable for solving the nonlinear large deformation problems. Therefore, it can be used to explore the relationship between the influence range of the surface movement (L) and geological mining conditions. Taking working faces A and B of two mines, through the establishment of a numerical model, the relationship between L and bedrock thickness, loose layer thickness, working face mining length, and overlying rock lithology is explored by using the control variable method. Moreover, the variation law is analyzed theoretically and mechanically. The results show that L is positively correlated with the thickness, while negatively correlated with the mining length. Similarly, L shows a slight increase after the key layer becomes weak. This study provides a scientific basis for reasonable coal mining and protection of surface buildings in the mining area. Integrating machine learning into the numerical model further increases the model throughput. The findings show that machine learning models had high accuracy in predicting surface subsidence, with the random forest trees and regression models having lower time and high accuracy, respectively.",2022-03-20,2022-08-24T07:42:46Z,2022-08-24T07:42:46Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000787203900005,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study evaluated the performance of the smart bed relative to polysomnography (PSG) in estimating epoch-by-epoch HR, BR, sleep vs. wake, mean overnight HR and BR, and summary sleep variables. Forty-five participants (aged 22-64 years; 55% women) slept one night on the smart bed with standard PSG. Smart bed data were compared to PSG by Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson correlation for epoch-by-epoch HR and epoch-by-epoch BR. Agreement in sleep vs. wake classification was quantified using Cohen's kappa, ROC analysis, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision. Epoch-by-epoch HR and BR were highly correlated with PSG (HR: r = 0.81, |bias| = 0.23 beats/min; BR: r = 0.71, |bias| = 0.08 breaths/min), as were estimations of mean overnight HR and BR (HR: r = 0.94, |bias| = 0.15 beats/min; BR: r = 0.96, |bias| = 0.09 breaths/min).

It is defined as the repeated blockage of the upper airway, which causes the interruption of breathing during sleep. According to the Frost and Sullivan calculation, the annual economic cost of undiagnosed sleep apnea is approximately $150 billion in the United States alone. Polysomnography (PSG) is the most comprehensive assessment method for sleep apnea and involves spending a night away from home attached to many sensors in a clinic bed. As a result, diagnosing sleep apnea is inconvenient and expensive. There has been much research in recent years to find a more convenient and inexpensive approach for sleep apnea classification. This study proposes a machine learning classification algorithm that processes short periods of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for obstructive sleep apnea detection. The effect of sleep apnea on cardiovascular variability was measured by extracting two characteristics of the ECG signal: the power of the very-low-frequency component and the standard deviation of R-R intervals. A new sleep apnea classification algorithm was developed based on K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) supervised learning and applied to 50 recordings from subjects with OSA and healthy subjects. The designed classification model can detect OSA patients with 90% accuracy in the testing dataset. The algorithm could be used as a platform for designing any mobile application or portable embedded system for detecting OSA.",2021,2022-08-24T07:42:49Z,2022-08-24T07:42:49Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000802227900138,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2021 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON E-HEALTH AND BIOENGINEERING (EHB 2021), 9TH EDITION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These glaciers experience a dramatic increase in velocity over short time periods, the surge, followed by an extended period of slow movement, the quiescence. This study aims at understanding why only few glaciers exhibit a transient behavior. We develop a machine learning framework to classify surge-type glaciers, based on their location, exposure, geometry, climatic mass balance and runoff. We apply this approach to the Svalbard archipelago, a region with a relatively homogeneous climate. We compare the performance of logistic regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning models that we apply to a newly combined database of glaciers in Svalbard. Based on the most accurate model, XGBoost, we compute surge probabilities along glacier centerlines and quantify the relative importance of several controlling features. Results show that the surface and bed slopes, ice thickness, glacier width, climatic mass balance, and runoff along glacier centerlines are the most significant features explaining surge probability for glaciers in Svalbard. A thicker and wider glacier with a low surface slope has a higher probability to be classified as surge-type, which is in good agreement with the existing theories of surging. Finally, we build a probability map of surge-type glaciers in Svalbard. The framework shows robustness on classifying surge-type glaciers that were not previously classified as such in existing inventories but have been observed surging.

However, it is less efficacious. A major unresolved clinical challenge is the inability to accurately predict who will respond to OA therapy. We recently developed a model to estimate obstructive sleep apnea pathophysiological endotypes. This study aimed to apply this physiological-based model to predict OA treatment responses. Methods: Sixty-two men and women with obstructive sleep apnea (aged 29-71 years) were studied to investigate the efficacy of a novel OA device. An in-laboratory diagnostic followed by an OA treatment efficacy polysomnography were performed. Seven polysomnography variables from the diagnostic study plus age and body mass index were included in our machine-learning-based model to predict OA therapy response according to standard apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) definitions. Initially, the model was trained on data from the first 45 participants using 10-fold cross-validation. A blinded independent validation was then performed for the remaining 17 participants. Results: Mean accuracy of the trained model to predict OA therapy responders vs nonresponders (AHI < 5 events/h) using 10-fold cross-validation was 91% +/- 8%. In the independent blinded validation, 100% (AHI < 5 events/h); 59% (AHI < 10 events/h); 71% (50% reduction in AHI); and 82% (50% reduction in AHI to < 20 events/h) of the 17 participants were correctly classified for each of the treatment outcome definitions respectively.

Accurate identification of bed separation location is necessary to prevent disasters caused by bed separation. However, conventional methods such as theoretical calculation and in situ investigation cannot comprehensively reflect the dynamic evolution of the bed separation during mining. In this study, bed separations were classified as either supported or unsupported based on the stress state of the strata below a given bed separation. Furthermore, a theoretical method (PDLS-method) for identifying the dynamic location and aperture of bed separations during mining was proposed. In addition, in situ investigation was carried out to determine the internal movement of overlying strata and evolution law of bed separation. Monitoring results indicate that the internal movement of overlying strata has characteristics of ""group movement"" and ""differential settlement"". The rock layers in a strata group move synchronously, and adjacent strata groups move independently. Bed separations occur along the interfaces of those strata groups. The evolution of bed separation can be divided into four stages of emergence, rapid growth, stability, and recession. The biggest aperture of bed separation at investigation borehole was 1.56 m.

Common risk events include bed fall, fall, scald, line dislodgement, drug extravasation, and drug administration error, which easily lead to nursing-patient disputes and seriously affect the prognosis of patients. In order to effectively avoid nursing risks, strengthening nursing risk management (NRM), improving nursing management mechanism, and improving nursing operation process have become effective ways to manage risks. The emergency department is an important window for rescuing critically ill patients in the hospital, and it is also the main department where diagnosis, nursing risk events, and medical disputes occur. The traditional risk care model has failed to meet the current demand for emergency patient management, and a more scientific and standardized management scheme is urgently needed. In order to improve the quality of NRM in emergency departments and combine the advantages and characteristics of big data-related technologies, this paper proposes an algorithm based on data mining for application in emergency care.

Approximately 3500 infants die from SIDS and sleep-related reasons on a yearly basis. Unintentional sleep-related deaths and bed sharing, a known risk factor for SIDS, are on the rise. Furthermore, ethnic disparities exist among those most affected by SIDS. Despite public health campaigns, infant mortality persists. Given the popularity of social media, understanding social media conversations around SIDS and safe sleep may assist the medical and public health communities with information needed to spread, reinforce, or counteract false information regarding SIDS and safe sleep. Objective: The objective of our study was to investigate the social media conversation around SIDS and safe sleep to understand the possible influences and guide health promotion efforts and public health research as well as enable health professionals to engage in directed communication regarding this topic. Methods: We used textual analytics to identify topics and extract meanings contained in unstructured textual data. Twitter messages were captured during September, October, and November in 2017. Tweets and retweets were collected using NUVI software in conjunction with Twitter's search API using the keywords: ""sids,"" ""infant death syndrome,"" ""sudden infant death syndrome,"" and ""safe sleep."" This returned a total of 41,358 messages, which were analyzed using text mining and social media monitoring software. Results: Multiple themes were identified, including recommendations for safe sleep to prevent SIDS, safe sleep devices, the potential causes of SIDS, and how breastfeeding reduces SIDS. Compared with September and November, more personal and specific stories of infant loss were demonstrated in October (Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month). The top influencers were news organizations, universities, and health-related organizations. Conclusions: We identified valuable topics discussed and shared on Twitter regarding SIDS and safe sleep. The study results highlight the contradicting information a subset of the population is exposed to regarding SIDS and the continued controversy over vaccines. In addition, this analysis emphasizes the lack of public health organizations' presence on Twitter compared with the influence of universities and news media organizations. The results also demonstrate the prevalence of safe sleep products that are embedded in safe sleep messaging.

This study is based on a large set of measurements collected from real pebbles, traced along the stream through radio-frequency identification tags after precipitation events. Two classes of data-driven models based on machine learning and functional geostatistics approaches are proposed and evaluated to predict the probability of movement of single pebbles within the stream. The first class built upon gradient-boosting decision trees allows one to estimate the probability of movement of a pebble based on the pebbles' geometrical features, river flow rate, location, and subdomain types. The second class is built upon functional kriging, a recent geostatistical technique that allows one to predict a functional profile-that is, the movement probability of a pebble, as a function of the pebbles' geometrical features or the stream's flow rate-at unsampled locations in the study area. Although grounded in different perspectives, both models aim to account for two main sources of uncertainty, namely, (1) the complexity of a river's morphological structure and (2) the highly nonlinear dependence between probability of movement, pebble size and shape, and the stream's flow rate. The performance of the two methods is extensively compared in terms of classification accuracy. The analyses show that despite the different perspectives, the overall performance is adequate and consistent, which suggests that both approaches can provide modeling frameworks for sediment transport. These data-driven approaches are also compared with physics-based ones that are classically used in the hydrological literature.

After that, we converted data coming from the sensors into images and applied a supervised deep learning approach. The scene was captured by a visible camera and the video from the visible camera was used as the ground truth. The deep learning network consisted of a convolutional neural network which automatically extracted features from infrared images. Overall average F1-score of all classes for the side mount was 0.9044 and for the overhead mount was 0.8893. Overall average accuracy of all classes for the side mount was 96.65% and for the overhead mount was 95.77%.

The causes of the SUDEP are still ambiguous, and the patients who suffer from epileptic seizures may face death during sleep, likely after an unwitnessed convulsive seizure. An important step towards SUDEP prevention is reliable seizure detection during sleep that is inexpensive and unobtrusive. In this work, we developed a non-contact, non-intrusive, privacy-preserving system that can detect convulsive movements experienced by human subjects. Detection is accomplished by a combination of uncooled lowcost, low-power, low-resolution (8 x 8) IR array sensor, and a deep learning algorithm implemented with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The thermopile sensor array is placed 1m from subjects who are reclining in bed. The CNN training set consists of thermal video streams from 40 healthy subjects mimicking convulsive movements or lying in bed without making convulsive movements. After training, the CNN was tested on thermal video streams not included in the training set and had a 99.2% accuracy in classifying convulsive movements and non-convulsive episodes, with no false negatives to distinguish between the occurrence and non-occurrence of convulsive movements.

In this study, firstly, we aim to assess the feasibility of using wearable sensors instead of traditional bedside monitors in the sepsis care management of hospital admitted patients, and secondly, to introduce automated prediction models for the mortality prediction of sepsis patients. To this end, we continuously monitored 50 sepsis patients for nearly 24 h after their admission to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Vietnam. We then compared the performance and interpretability of state-of-the-art ML models for the task of mortality prediction of sepsis using the heart rate variability (HRV) signal from wearable sensors and vital signs from bedside monitors. Our results show that all ML models trained on wearable data outperformed ML models trained on data gathered from the bedside monitors for the task of mortality prediction with the highest performance (area under the precision recall curve = 0.83) achieved using time-varying features of HRV and recurrent neural networks.

This occurrence consists of high-grade molybdenite-bearing granites that occur within the large Pabineau Falls Granite (PFG). To help evaluate the evolution of this occurrence, a large composite sample containing disseminated, very coarse molybdenite (up to 5.02 wt% MoS2) was collected from mineralized granitic blocks excavated from a blasted trench. Although the host rocks are assumed to be PFG, being the only defined intrusive body in the area, major- and trace-element geochemical data together with U-Pb geochronological results suggest that the molybdenite is hosted by an intrusion distinct from the PFG. The radiogenic Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotopic data of the host intrusion are consistent with Gander Zone granites of the Appalachians orogenic system. The PLM's granitic host rock is characterized by a high silica content (78.93 wt% SiO2), an enrichment in incompatible elements, and a high molybdenum content. The high initial Sr-87/Sr-86 of 0.71268, negative ENd of -1.28, and high Pb isotope ratios together with trace- and major-element concentrations indicate a moderately to highly radiogenic Sr source and derivation from a significant amount of supracrustal materials, with a contribution from the upper mantle; a source similar to that proposed for the Gander Zone Siluro-Devonian granitic bodies. A positive epsilon Hf (+1.34) also suggests involvement of sedimentary components. This is consistent with elevated Cr (20 ppm) and Ni (20 ppm). The involvement of a pelagic sedimentary component is invoked to explain the enrichment in elements commonly associated with mafic compositions. A new precise, LA ICP-MS zircon crystallization age of 390 +/- 1 Ma makes the PLM host granite Middle Devonian, which argues against a direct relationship with the older PFG (397.2 +/- 1.9 Ma). The new age opens the possibility of an as yet undelineated, mineralized intrusion within the Gander Zone, which has perhaps been missed during previous investigations due to the extensive glacio-fluvial cover and very limited bedrock exposures. Alternatively, the younger age could be attributed to very slow cooling and/or intra-pluton fractionation, resulting in a younger much more fractionated phase of the PFG. However, there is no geochemical evidence for such a prolonged continuous fractional crystallization process. Notably, recent geophysical surveys on the Bathurst Mining Camp indicate that the PFG is substantively larger than its surface expression as it continues to the east beneath the Carboniferous unconformity. Comparing ages of PLM and PFG with the nearby Nicholas-Denys Granodiorite (381 +/- 4 Ma) and Antinouri Lake Granite (372 +/- 4 Ma), it appears that magmatic activity in the region occurred every 10 Myr over a span of about 30 Myr. Collectively, this evidence suggests the potential of significant buried intrusions within this tectonic belt of the Gander Zone. At the PLM, this might include exposure of an otherwise hidden intrusion that is younger and much more fractionated than the PFG. More detailed geophysical and geochemical analyses would be required to revise the current geological map and, most importantly, trace unmapped units at depth to possible additional mineralized sequences.",2022-03,2022-08-24T07:42:56Z,2022-08-24T07:42:56Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,234,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000820501800002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The National Institutes of General Medical Science sepsis research working group recommendations call for application of new research approaches in extant clinical data sets to improve efficiency of early trials of new sepsis therapies. Our objective is to apply machine learning approaches to derive computable 24-h sepsis phenotypes to facilitate personalized enrollment in early anti-inflammatory trials targeting these conditions. Methods: We applied consensus, k-means clustering analysis to our extant PHENOtyping sepsis-induced Multiple organ failure Study (PHENOMS) dataset of 404 children. 24-hour computable phenotypes are derived using 25 available bedside variables including C-reactive protein and ferritin. Results: Four computable phenotypes (PedSep-A, B, C, and D) are derived. Compared to all other phenotypes, PedSep-A patients (n =135; 2% mortality) were younger and previously healthy, with the lowest C-reactive protein and ferritin levels, the highest lymphocyte and platelet counts, highest heart rate, and lowest creatinine (p < 0.05); PedSep-B patients (n =102; 12% mortality) were most likely to be intubated and had the lowest Glasgow Coma Scale Score (p < 0.05); PedSep-C patients (n = 110; mortality 10%) had the highest temperature and Glasgow Coma Scale Score, least pulmonary failure, and lowest lymphocyte counts (p < 0.05); and PedSep-D patients (n=56,34% mortality) had the highest creatinine and number of organ failures, including renal, hepatic, and hematologic organ failure, with the lowest platelet counts (p < 0.05). PedSep-D had the highest likelihood of developing thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure (Adj OR 47.51 95% CI [18.83-136.83], p < 0.0001) and macrophage activation syndrome (Adj OR 38.63 95% CI [13.26-137.75], p < 0.0001).

The proposed approach relies on learning the underlying PDEs in the form of a physics-constrained loss function to improve the accuracy of process simulations. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by considering the complex dynamics of binary solute mixtures for generic pulse injections subjected to different isotherm systems, namely, the four cases of the generalized Langmuir isotherms. Unique neural network models were developed for each isotherm and the models accurately predicted the spatiotemporal concentrations of solute mixture in chromatographic columns for an arbitrary feed concentrations and injection volumes by facilitating up to 250 times computational speed-ups.

With the increased demand for unobtrusive yet quantifiable respiratory monitoring, many technologies have been proposed recently. However, there are challenges to be addressed for such technologies to enable widespread use. In this work, we explore the feasibility of using load cell sensors embedded on a hospital bed for monitoring respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (TV). We propose a globalized machine learning (ML)-based algorithm for estimating TV without the requirement of subject-specific calibration or training. In a study of 15 healthy subjects performing respiratory tasks in four different postures, the outputs from four load cell channels and the reference spirometer were recorded simultaneously. A signal processing pipeline was implemented to extract features that capture respiratory movement and the respiratory effects on the cardiac (i.e., ballistocardiogram, BCG) signals. The proposed RR estimation algorithm achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.6 breaths per minute (brpm) against the ground truth RR from the spirometer. The TV estimation results demonstrated that combining all three axes of the low-frequency force signals and the BCG heartbeat features best quantifies the respiratory effects of TV. The model resulted in a correlation and RMSE between the estimated and true TV values of 0.85 and 0.23 L, respectively, in the posture independent model without electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.

In Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure (LUNG SAFE; n=2813), a multinational, observational ARDS cohort, we applied a custom classifier model (with fewer variables than the primary model) to determine the prognostic value of the subphenotypes and tested their interaction with the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) strategy, with 90-day mortality as the dependent variable. Findings The primary clinical classifier model had an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.95) in EARLI and 0.88 (0.84-0.91) in VALID. Performance of the primary model was similar when using exclusively EHR-derived predictors compared with manually curated predictors (AUC=0.88 [95% CI 0.81-0.94] vs 0.92 [0.88-0.97]). In LUNG SAFE, 90-day mortality was higher in patients assigned the hyperinflammatory subphenotype than in those with the hypoinflammatory phenotype (414 [57%] of 725 vs 694 [33%] of 2088; p<0.0001). There was a significant treatment interaction with PEEP strategy and ARDS subphenotype (p=0.041), with lower 90-day mortality in the high PEEP group of patients with the hyperinflammatory subphenotype (hyperinflammatory subphenotype: 169 [54%] of 313 patients in the high PEEP group vs 127 [62%] of 205 patients in the low PEEP group; hypoinflammatory subphenotype: 231 [34%] of 675 patients in the high PEEP group vs 233 [32%] of 734 patients in the low PEEP group). Interpretation Classifier models using clinical variables alone can accurately assign ARDS subphenotypes in observational cohorts. Application of these models can provide valuable prognostic information and could inform management strategies for personalised treatment, including application of PEEP, once prospectively validated.

A mobile robot may need to slow down in presence of children, elderly or dense crowds. A robot's movement needs to be precise and socially adjustable especially in a hospital setting. Identifying key objects in a scene can provide important contextual awareness to a robot. Traditional approaches used handcrafted features along with object proposals to detect objects in images. Recently, object detection has made tremendous progress over the past few years thanks to deep learning and convolutional neural networks. Networks such as SSD, YOLO, and Faster R-CNN have made significant improvements over traditional techniques while maintaining real-time inference speed. However, current existing datasets used for benchmarking these models tend to contain mainly outdoor images using a high-quality camera setup that is usually different from a robotic vision setting where a robot moves around in a dynamic environment resulting in sensor noise, motion blur, and change in data distribution.

Sympathetic and parasympathetic balance can be measured quantitatively at the bedside using multiple methods, most readily by extracting data from electrocardiographic or photoplethysmography waveforms. Work from our group and others has demonstrated that data-analytic techniques can identify quantitative physiologic changes that precede clinical detection of meaningful events, and therefore may provide an important window for time-sensitive therapies.

Some of them stay in long-term care facilities. Elderly people with night wandering behaviour may lose their way, leading to a significant risk of injuries. The eNightLog system was developed to monitor the night-time bedside activities of older people in order to help them cope with this issue. It comprises a 3D time-of-flight near-infrared sensor and an ultra-wideband sensor for detecting human presence and to determine postures without a video camera. A threshold-based algorithm was developed to classify different activities, such as leaving the bed. The system is able to send alarm messages to caregivers if an elderly user performs undesirable activities. In this study, 17 sets of eNightLog systems were installed in an elderly hostel with 17 beds in 9 bedrooms.

Application scenarios include video quality adaptation as a function of the 5G network quality at predicted user locations, and augmented reality apps that speed up content rendering based on predicted user locations. Such use cases require prediction error in the same range as the GPS error, and no existing works on location prediction can achieve this level of accuracy. We propose Federated Meta-Location Learning (FMLL) on smart phones for fine-grained location prediction, based on GPS traces collected on the phones. FMLL has three components: a meta-location generation module, a prediction model, and a federated learning framework. The meta-location generation module represents the user location data as relative points in an abstract 2D space, which enables learning across different physical spaces. The model fuses Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), where BiLSTM learns the speed and direction of the mobile users, and CNN learns information such as user movement preferences. The framework runs on the phones of the users and also on a server that coordinates learning from all users in the system. FMLL uses federated learning to protect user privacy and reduce bandwidth consumption. Our experimental results, using a dataset with over 600,000 users, demonstrate that FMLL outperforms baseline models in terms of prediction accuracy. We also demonstrate that FMLL works well in conjunction with transfer learning, which enables model reusability.

Proximie is an augmented reality (AR) platform that can display up to 4 native camera views, with live or semi live telementoring. It can optimise ergonomics of the surgeon at the console (2), and robotic instrument orientation. We describe the utilisation of Proximie as a step-by-step guide in a robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Surgical Technique: Author V. P. performed a transperitoneal multiport da Vinci Xi RARP with the Proximie platform: a laptop computer, multiple HD webcams, microphones and speakers. Using an HDMI cable to the Intuitive Surgical tower, output display from the console and an additional laparoscopic tower is shown. Each webcam was mounted to the side armrests of the console, directed at the surgeon's hands. An independent 'drop in' laparoscope via an additional 5mm left upper quadrant port was utilised. Observers can visualise the AR platform's recordings on a laptop and/or smartphone. A PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) camera can capture the operating room, bedside assistant, ports and patient position. Our video demonstrates three of four camera views for posture, forearm, wrist, hand, and finger orientation, relative to the translated robotic steps. A pincer grasp of the endowrist manipulator during anastomosis allows optimal robotic wrist rotation. The second laparoscopic camera view demonstrated intracorporeal angles of robotic arm and bedside assistant's instrument position for critical steps such as nerve sparing and anastomosis (3). The console time was 100 minutes, no intraoperative complications, or delay in image transmission occurred with utilising the platform. Considerations: An AR platform can create deeper learning for RARP in real time or recorded sessions. Two-way verbal and visual communication with ability to annotate on screen, allows long distance mentoring. The platform's utility can be accessed in anywhere, to project surgeons beyond their immediate environment. This allows for democratisation of access to high volume institutions and their evolution of techniques (4), to assist patients globally. Potential developments are artificial intelligence (AI) networks analysing repository of such recorded data, to identify intraoperative hand motion and robotic instrument tracking.

The Bay is characterized by sluggish water circulation with a vertically well-mixed water column. The strength of the residual estuarine current (& UDelta;u) was enhanced by the combined effects of decreased tidal currents, increased precipitation, and down-estuary (northerly) winds, whereas & UDelta;u was weakened by increased tidal currents and up-estuary (southerly) winds. The variability of current asymmetry originated from & UDelta;u contributed to the entrapment of suspended sediments, creating a mobile sediment pool in central regions of the Bay. The sediments resuspended from the mobile sediment pool were more influenced by residual currents than the tidal currents, and they remained in suspension near bed. When the down-estuary winds were applied to the mobile sediment pool, the near-bed sediments were readily resuspended to form an STM > 40 mg l(-1). The STM moved up-estuary by persistent high & UDelta;u and down-estuary by an intermittent low & UDelta;u. Over the entire measurement periods, the STM moved by at least 450 m toward the up-estuary. As the consolidated sediment layer was exposed by the movement of the STM, near-bed currents were ineffective in resuspending sediments from the consolidated layer even though the winds provided sufficient current strength. Due to the depletion of available sediments for resuspension, the STM was not fully generated. This study highlights that the STM in a microtidal estuary can be determined by the combined function of various forcings such as tide, wind, and precipitation.",2022-04,2022-08-24T07:43:03Z,2022-08-24T07:43:03Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,446,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000774201300001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This deficiency explains the persistence of freehand placement of external ventricular drains, which has an inherent risk of inaccurate positioning, multiple passes, tract hemorrhage, and injury to adjacent brain parenchyma. Here, the authors introduce and validate a novel image registration and real-time tracking system for frameless stereotactic neuronavigation and catheter placement in the nonimmobilized patient. METHODS Computer vision technology was used to develop an algorithm that performed near- continuous, automatic, and marker-less image registration. The program fuses a subject's preprocedure CT scans to live 3D camera images (Snap-Surface), and patient movement is incorporated by artificial intelligence- driven recalibration (Real-Track). The surface registration error (SRE) and target registration error (TRE) were calculated for 5 cadaveric heads that underwent serial movements (fast and slow velocity roll, pitch, and yaw motions) and several test conditions, such as surgical draping with limited anatomical exposure and differential subject lighting. Six catheters were placed in each cadaveric head (30 total placements) with a simulated sterile technique. Postprocedure CT scans allowed comparison of planned and actual catheter positions for user error calculation. RESULTS Registration was successful for all 5 cadaveric specimens, with an overall mean (+/- standard deviation) SRE of 0.429 +/- 0.108 mm for the catheter placements. Accuracy of TRE was maintained under 1.2 mm throughout specimen movements of low and high velocities of roll, pitch, and yaw, with the slowest recalibration time of 0.23 seconds. There were no statistically significant differences in SRE when the specimens were draped or fully undraped (p = 0.336). Performing registration in a bright versus a dimly lit environment had no statistically significant effect on SRE (p = 0.742 and 0.859, respectively). For the catheter placements, mean TRE was 0.862 +/- 0.322 mm and mean user error (difference between target and actual catheter tip) was 1.674 +/- 1.195 mm. CONCLUSIONS This computer vision-based registration system provided real-time tracking of cadaveric heads with a recalibration time of less than one-quarter of a second with submillimetric accuracy and enabled catheter placements with millimetric accuracy. Using this approach to guide bedside ventriculostomy could reduce complications, improve safety, and be extrapolated to other frameless stereotactic applications in awake, nonimmobilized patients.",2022-05,2022-08-24T07:43:03Z,2022-08-24T07:43:03Z,NA,1475-1484,NA,5,136,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000796384100001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To monitor the EDM process using virtual metrology (VM), we need to obtain the electrode's voltage and current signals of a machine tool. Due to the nature of EDM, the sensors installed on the machine tool acquire the signals at a high sampling rate and generate a vast amount of data in a short time, thereby raising the big-data processing issue. Our previous work proposed an efficient approach called BEDPS to process the EDM big data in a Hadoop distributed cluster. This paper presents a novel big data processing approach to feature extraction for EDM by using container technology (i.e., Docker and Kubernetes). We reimplement some Spark algorithms of BEDPS in Python (originally in Scala) and then run the refined BEDPS in containers in a Kubernetes cluster. Testing results show that the refined BEDPS developed in this study can reduce the execution time by almost half, compared to the original Scala version (9.6577 minutes vs. 19.2735 minutes). The adoption of Python in Spark is also shown to have similar performance with Scala, although there are some cases where Python performance falls short, for example, parallel processing using Python parallel processing library. The results also show that the Kubernetes cluster is promising to be an alternative way, other than the Hadoop, for processing big data. At the same time, it can bring some advantages to the big data processing applications, such as easy deployment, robustly running, load balance, self-healing, failover, and horizontal auto-scaling for containerized applications.",2021,2022-08-24T07:43:04Z,2022-08-24T07:43:04Z,NA,142-147,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000786590200030,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yau, HT; Stenzel, R; Shyu, ML; Lin, HC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"22ND IEEE/ACIS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, NETWORKING AND PARALLEL/DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING (SNPD 2021-FALL)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The mineral phases in the samples were identified and characterized through macroscopic observation, XRD (X-ray diffraction) analysis, optical microscopy, and FE-SEM (field emission-scanning electron microscopy). The results show that the siderite occurs in the drill core from depths of 664.07 to 729.21 m, where its content varies from 15.1 to 65.7%, 31.3% on average. Modes of occurrence of authigenic siderite include irregular banded or massive aggregates, discrete fine particles, oolitic aggregates, and double or multi-ring ellipsoid-shaped or rhombohedral aggregates. The mineralogical association with quartz, anatase, ilmenite, chromite, and zircon with sharp-edged outlines, high-temperature cracks and/or corroded embayments, and REE-bearing minerals and geochemical characteristics such as Al2O3/TiO2 between 3 and 8, less commonly 8-23.77, indicate that abundant siderite was produced by hydrothermal alteration of airborne volcaniclastic materials. The delta C-13(PDB), delta O-18(PDB), and delta O-18(SMOW) values of siderite in the argillized tuff range from -12.56 to -1.32 parts per thousand, -8.98 to -5.88 parts per thousand, and 21.60 to 24.80 parts per thousand, respectively. In the delta C-13(PDB)-delta O-18(SMOW) diagram, plots of the studied siderite are distributed between the fields of marine carbonate rocks, sedimentary organic matter, and carbonates of hydrothermal ores. Some siderite from the upper part of the studied borehole is isotopically close to REY carbonates from the Abramovka lignite deposit, Far Eastern Russia, which precipitated from evolved basinal waters mixed with CO2 from a mantle source. In summary, this indicates a hybrid origin for the studied siderite including carbonate dissolution, dehydroxylation of sedimentary organic matter, and hydrothermal activity. Furthermore, the paleosalinity (Z) and paleotemperature (T) of the ore-forming fluids were calculated based on the age-corrected stable carbon and oxygen isotopic data in the samples. The Z values range from 96.65 to 121.5 parts per thousand, suggesting the formation of siderite under brackish-water conditions. The T values vary from 19.47 to 47.12 degrees C, with some sharp fluctuations that may be due to ash falls and/or hydrothermal injections. Overall, our data support the model for critical-metal Nb(Ta)-Zr(Hf)-REY-Ga enrichment in tuffaceous deposits of southwest China including a combination of volcanic activity and terrestrial organic-rich sedimentation under warm and humid conditions, followed by low-temperature alteration evolved from acidic leaching, which is responsible for the Nb-Zr-REY-Ga enrichment, and, subsequently, formation of authigenic siderite with associated quartz, sulfide minerals, and phosphate minerals under reducing neutral/weakly alkaline conditions.",2022-03-20,2022-08-24T07:43:08Z,2022-08-24T07:43:08Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,592,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000768022400003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the final effects on the electrical activity of the brain remain relatively sparse. Here, we have analyzed of the alpha and theta electroencephalographic oscillations during the realization of the arrest reaction (AR; eyes close/eyes open transition) when a chromotherapy session performed in a dedicated room [Rebalance (RB) device], with an ergonomic bed integrating pulsed-wave light (PWL) stimulation, guided breathing, and body scan exercises. We demonstrated that the PWL induced an evoked-related potential characterized by the N2-P3 components maximally recorded on the fronto-central areas and accompanied by an event-related synchronization (ERS) of the delta-theta-alpha oscillations. The power of the alpha and theta oscillations was analyzed during repeated ARs testing realized along with the whole RB session. We showed that the power of the alpha and theta oscillations was significantly increased during the session in comparison to their values recorded before. Of the 14 participants, 11 and 6 showed a significant power increase of the alpha and theta oscillations, respectively. These increased powers were not observed in two different control groups (n = 28) who stayed passively outside or inside the RB room but without any type of stimulation.

Data concerning five karst bauxite deposits, each related to a different stratigraphic position within the bedrock, were selected to address the chemical distribution and inter-elemental relationships, especially for critical elements, factors that control bauxite formation, and the parental affinity. The analyzed samples, mainly clayey bauxite and bauxitic clay, are characterized by large compositional fluctuations involving both major and trace elements. The major element composition is dominated by SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, and Fe2O3. Among the critical elements, compositional fluctuations induce the occurrence of outliers for Co, Nb, Ta, LREE, and HREE, similar to other trace elements, such as Ba, Sr, Cr, U, and Zr. Elemental mobility indicates that most of elements are generally depleted. Among the critical elements, Co is enriched only in several samples of the older deposits, and Sigma REE are enriched in some samples of the younger deposits. Factor analysis suggests that, due to the observed Al-Ga co-variance, fairly acidic conditions were never attained during bauxitization, and that detrital resistant minerals concentrated during a bauxitization stage, promoting Al-Ti accumulation. Furthermore, the U co-variance with low soluble elements (Nb, Ta, and Th) suggests that U was mostly conservative during the formation of deposits. Cobalt covaries with Cr, and these elements accumulated during later bauxitization stages, when the massive leaching of silica occurred. The CIA, CIW, and PIA paleo-weathering proxies indicate an upward weathering increase, which suggests a trend toward more extreme weathering conditions in a wetter and warmer climate, according to the Permian global warming. This is consistent with an upward increasing Ba/Sr ratio and the inspection of the A-CN-K plot, where the younger deposits fall close to the A-K edge, involving a clayey precursor requires a rainfall increase. Interestingly, the upward trend toward a warmer and wetter climate was also coupled with paleo-redox conditions promoting cerium oxidation, as depicted by the Ce/Ce* values. Finally, the Eu anomaly and the Sm/Nd ratio indicate that the studied bauxite deposits were mainly derived from a mafic protolith that formed in the middle-late Permian, as a consequence of the volcanism that affected the entire Iranian platform. A cluster of karst bauxites, however, has Eu/Eu* values lower than the average-standard deviation range of the mafic rocks, suggesting a possible contribution of a more differentiated and less mafic protolith. Similarly, the U/Th ratio, at large, supports the hypothesis of a mafic protolith for the middle-late Permian bauxite deposits, although some samples show the U/Th values well above the average-standard deviation range of the mafic rocks, likely indicating that processes promoting the accumulation of resistant minerals with high U/Th ratios cannot be excluded. This means that, in this case, the U/Th ratio does not necessarily reflect the protolith of karst bauxites and that, more in general, this proxy needs to be carefully interpreted when used to assess the parental affinity of residual rocks.",2020-09,2022-08-24T07:43:11Z,2022-08-24T07:43:11Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,124,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000564739000001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Based on the measured channel data from 2003 to 2018, this study investigates changes in the waterway dimension and the factors that impact navigation conditions. The navigation-obstructing channels in the permanent backwater area (PBA) mainly resulted from the occurrence of fine grained sedimentation, which led to a decrease in the effective navigable width. Meanwhile, in the fluctuating backwater area (FBA), bed load behavior during the falling stage from April to June lowered navigation depths. Decreasing sediment supply can alleviate reservoir sedimentation and maintain navigation safety in the PBA, while it is necessary to focus on the waterway depth clearance that is sensitive to temporary deposition during the falling stage of high water-sediment discharge years in the FBA. Water level variation near gravel excavation pits indicates that sediment mining decreases waterway depth, negatively impacting the navigable dimension, especially during low water discharge. These findings provide useful information for assessing the sustainable development of the navigation in the Three Gorges Reservoir, and aid economic development in the Yangtze River.",2021-05,2022-08-24T07:45:34Z,2022-08-24T07:45:34Z,NA,NA,NA,9,14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000681070300002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
